</div>Gynecomastia can occur if the underlying cause was not identified and continues to make an impact on the tissues. However, it is rare for it to recur.
<p>You should review all of your medications prior to undergoing the procedure. (Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are situations in which gynecomastia can recur. It can be caused by certain medications and endocrine conditions. </p><p>If there are not stopped or corrected, it can recur. If all of the glandular tissue is not removed, it can recur.</p><p>Lastly, a weight gain can lead to recurrence. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Gynecomastia can recur after any type of surgery. the breast tissue is never completely removed and there is also fat in the area. But, given that, it is unusal for that to happen and even more unusual is to get a recurrence to the same size as before surgery. (John P. Stratis, MD, Harrisburg Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Re-Growth Following Male Breast Reduction is Unusual </strong><p>It’s unusual for patients to experience re-growth of breast tissue following surgical correction of gynecomastia. Even though re-growth is rare, it can occasionally occur and this may be for a variety of reasons. It’s important to realize that when breast tissue is removed during surgery, some breast tissue and fat is always left behind.</p><p>This residual breast tissue can be impacted by weight gain, hormonal imbalance, marijuana, alcohol, steroids, and a variety of drugs. For these reasons, recurrent gynecomastia should be carefully evaluated to determine its cause. This may require consultation with an endocrinologist.</p><p>In most cases, correction of the underlying cause will address the problem, but occasionally revisional surgery may be necessary. If recurrence of gynecomastia occurs, it’s important to discuss the problem with your plastic surgeon.</p><p>Although this problem is unusual, your surgeon should be able to make an appropriate recommendation. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>If you gain weight then excess fat may contribute to gynecomastia. Saggy skin and some medications can also do this. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)
<p>When gynecomastia is properly treated with removal of the involved tissue the risk of recurrence is very low. This risk may be greater if there are underlying conditions or medications which caused the condition originally.</p><p>A thorough evaluation by a board certified plastic surgeon should help in determining if further studies are needed or if consultation with other physicians would be required. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Can male breasts return after surgical removal?</i></p><p>No, the gland will not regrow to any significant degree, and the fatty tissue likewise will not return. If someone goes on to gain a significant amount of weight, the fat will be evenly distributed around the body.</p><p>It will not focus on the breast as it had before surgery. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>To remove man boobs, you need both liposuction and excision of the breast tissue under the nipples. If male breast reduction includes both of these steps thoroughly, then the gynecomastia will not grow back. But technique is very important. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Man boobs grow back due to identifiable reasons</em></p><p>The vast majority of manboobs or gynecomastia cases are not caused by an identifiable mechanism. But, there are many drugs, supplements and disease processes that may cause breast growth in men. If you do not have an underlying, unidentifiable reason for breast growth (such as taking anabolics, using certain stomach anti-acids, having certain tumors that produce hormones that stimulate breast growth etc etc) and your weight does not fluctuate, then you should not have a regrowth of breast tissue which has been removed in a gynecomastia procedure. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Breast tissue can grow back after male breast tissue removal.</strong><p>Recurrenc of breast tissue after excision is possible but uncommon. The nipple and areola are part of the breast and can give rise to a small amount of recurrence. Reexcision might be helpful. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>It’s possible but not typical</em></p><p>It depends on the cause of your gynecomastia. If you have a tendency to store fat in your breasts, then it is possible that with subsequent significant weight gain your gynecomastia may return. Certain medications and supplements may also contribute to its development. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In general the results are permaned , but some patients prefer to have absolutioely no chest. This may prompt them to come back for seconday procedures requesting complete removal of all breast tissue. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Generally permanent results</h5><p>With surgical excision of breast tissue (and not just lipo), it is very unlikely that the breast tissue will grow back. The main thing is to ensure an adequate, surgical excision of gland. (Tim Neavin, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Recurrent Gynecomastia or Male Breast Enlargement </strong></p><p>Results are usually permanent after the extra breast tissue is removed. There are some factors that can cause the recurrance of gynecomastia such as weight gain, steroids, and hormones. As with breast reduction in women, repeat reduction procedures are occasionally required when subsequent enlargement has occurred. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Gynecomastia recurrence</em></p><p>Like a female breast reduction, the tissue that is removed will obviously not “recur”. However, your chest contour will change if you gain weight or increase muscle mass and may appear to contribute to a recurrence of your unwanted chest shape.<br>

</div>Furthermore, because not all of the breast gland is removed during most gynecomastia reductions, there is some potential for the remaining tissue to become hypertrophic again. This is most likely if the patient ingests substances or drugs that can stimulate enlargement of the remaining gland, such as steroids, hormones, marijuana, and a few others.
<p>Significant recurrence is rare, but usually due to this issue. Repeat gynecomastia procedures are occasionally (but rarely) necessary. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Is Gynecomastia a Permanent Fix</i></p><p>For most patients who have gynecomastia surgery, the results are permanent as the fat combined with tissue that was removed is permanently gone. However, if there is still fat and a small amount of glandular tissue left after the surgery and if patients have hormonal issues or engage in activity such as anabolic steroid use which created the problem in the first place, then it can recur although usually to a lesser degree.<br>

</div>Additionally, as patients age and get into their 50s or 60s it is very common for testosterone levels to change and for more fat and glandular tissue development to occur in the chest. You can be comforted that most patients that have gynecomastia surgery do not need a second procedure, but if it becomes necessary at a later point, it is certainly possible to do this. (Robert Cohen, MD, Santa Monica Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Gynecomastia permanent results</i></p><p>If the gynecomastia is treated with liposuction only, there is always a small chance of recurrence since only fat is removed. If the tissue is excised (totally) the risk for recurrence is very small. Leaving a small amount of tissue behind will increase the chance of recurrence and is not recommended in my practice. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Male breasts returning after treatment for gynecomastia</em></p><p>Most men have breast tissue and or fatty tissue removed to “reduce” the breasts. If you gain weight or if the breast tissue was not removed, you may see the breasts reappear. If any other stimulant is being used, like steroids, you may also see the breasts reappear. For most men, the breasts do not return. (Jeffrey Ditesheim, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>If you undergo liposuction of the breasts for correction of gynecomastia and then gain weight, the condition can recur so it is important to maintain a stable weight. If you have resection of the glandular tissue, the condition should not recur unless there is a hormonal component which stimulates whatever breast tissue remains.
<p>It is important to rule out hormonal causes for gynecomastia and to see an endocrinologist prior to surgery if this is suspected. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When the Gynecomastia is real Glandular tissue,and the excision is adequate there is only a tiny chance it will reocurre after surgery. </p><p>When fatty tissue is invoved weight gain may slighly incease the breast size=Peudo-Gynecomastia. (Mordcai Blau, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Since breasts are made of fat and breast tissue, there is always a possibility that if you gain or lose weight – this may alter your breast volume after gynecomastia surgery. There are also certain drugs, legal and illegal, that can affect breast size.</p><p>That being said, surgical results are usually long lasting and most men are very happy with their surgical outcome. Remember, a healthy lifestyle, diet and exercise program are key to a patients overall success. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Gynecomastia may re-occur after surgery but not commonly.</h3><p>Even with the most successful corrective surgery to the male breast, some tissue remains that could be stimulated to enlarge over time. This is more common with less complete treatments such as with liposuction only strategies.</p><p>However, the best methods of preventing a recurrence are up to the patient. Staying fit and avoiding substances known to promote gynecomastia such as anabolic steroids, cannabis (marijuana) and some prescription medications that your Specialist can educate you about is your best strategy after successful corrective surgery. (Mathew C. Mosher, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can “man boobs” grow back?</h3><p>Gynecomastia surgery in most cases can be long term, however, this depends on the cause for the gynecomastia. If drug realted (i.e. steroids) or weight gain, gynecomasia can recur. (Robert Sleightholm, MD, Brampton Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<i>Regrowth of Chest After Gynecomastia</i><p>While a gynecomastia surgery can potentially have permanent results, it is indeed possible for the chest to grow in size after the procedure. Significant weight gain or stimulated glandular tissue can cause the resurgence of the area, and can thus reverse the effects of surgery.</p><p>Still, if performed properly and if diet and exercise are maintained, the results of a gynecomastia surgery should be dramatic and long-lasting. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction, and particularly ultrasound liposuction is an excellent technique for the correction of gynecomastia. After we remove the fat, the fat is permanently. Your body will not re-create fat to this area. However any fat that remains may enlarge with significant weight gain.</p><p>For this reason, we recommend that all patients initiate a rigorous exercise regimen and a balanced diet after their gynecomastia surgery. This will ensure that they have long-lasting and great-looking results. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Return of MOOBs After Gynecomastia Surgery</h3><p>Although surgery for gynecomastia can be done in many different ways, the premise is the same for all procedures, remove the appearance of breasts. Gynecomastia can take the form of simply enlarged nipple/areolas (most common), enlarged breast tissue in lean males (can be due to anabolic steroids), adolescent gynecomastia (can affect 30-60% of males) and adult onset (often due to obesity).</p><p>But regardless of the type enough breast tissue must be removed to decrease the appearance of breasts without damaging the blood supply to the tissues resulting in tissue necrosis. So with all of that said a very small amount of breast tissue, usually 5-10mm in depth, behind the areola must be left to ensure survival of the nipple/areola.<br>

</div>The remainder of the breast tissue and chest wall fat is removed. This is usually not enough tissue to cause the reappearance of breasts but some hypertrophy is possible if the tissue is subject to anabolic steroids or excessive weight gain. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)
<p>There are multiple causes for gynecomastia. If the intial problem is the result of drug use and the use is not curtailed them it is likely the problem will recurr. If the initial cause of gynecomastia is due to an undiagnosed medical problem ie a pituitary tumor or an adrenal tumor then recurrance is a posibility.</p><p>If new drugs are introduced ie in the case of chemotherapy recurrance may occur. If one has weight gain recurrance may obviously occur. I have seen some cases where a small fraction of the intial resection has recurred but these cases are unusual often what is palpable is nothing more than scar tissue. (Jay M. Pensler, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Typically once the excess breast tissue is removed the results are permanent. However, if there is significant weight gain or excessive internal scar formation from the surgery, it may appear that the gynecomastia has returned.
<p>That is not the typical outcome and once you have surgery you should expect the results to be permanent. As with any surgery there are risks involved and recurrence, although rare, can happen. Most commonly patients are very satisfied and happy with the outcome of their gynecomastia correction.</p><p>It gives them much more confidence and a more masculine appearance with form fitting clothing or on the beach. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Gynecomastia surgery and return of fullness</i></p><p>Very rarely a medication or hormonal imbalance can be responsible for the development of excess breast tissue in men. if the medication or herb is continued or if the hormonal imbalance is not corrected then there may be a chance of recurrence of breast tissue.</p><p></p>

</div>The fullness in the chest in gynecomastia is often a combination of breast tissue and fat. Most often there is no direct cause for the increased growth of the breast tissue component of gynecomastia or “man boobs”.
<p>Since some of the fullness may be from fat, if you were to gain significant weight after gynecomastia surgery you could have recurrence. (John E. Gross, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For men undergoing gynecomastia surgery, often the exicision of the involved tissue will be a permanent change. </p><p>It is unlikely that they will grow back unless tissue was left behind, you are taking medications that might stimulate growth, or you gain excessive weight. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Can breasts grow back after gynecomastia surgery?</strong></p><p>Gynecomastia surgery removes a combination of breast tissue and fatty tissue. Most patients have gynecomastia that is not associated with certain diseases or medications or drugs. It is important to remember that if you gain fat due to poor diet and exercise, then the fatty tissue left over in the chest can grow again.</p><p></p>

</div>In addition, if you have a disease, medication, or drug associated with your gynecomastia, and if that is not controlled, then it will most certainly recur. However, for the vast majority of patients, I have been doing VASER liposuction without any recurrence at all. (Sirish Maddali, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)
<p>After surgery for gynecomastia, you can develop a recurrence. This is especially prominent in men that don’t follow a good diet and exercise routine. The extra fat in your diet can be re-distributed to your breasts causing them to be large again.</p><p>However, after surgery for gynecomastia if you do eat a balanced diet and exercise routinely, your results should last a long time.
