<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Areola reduction is usually a straightforward procedure. Like any procedure, there are risks. There will be a scar around the circumference of your areola. </p><p>It is your body, and this decision should not be taken lightly. If you are planning on getting pregnant in the near future, it may be best to wait. (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Areola reduction is a quick and inexpensive surgery </h3><p>Patients have many different options for breast contouring. If a patient is interested in changing the shape or size of the areola, and they do not require any other breast work, this may be treated with a quick and inexpensive surgery that may be performed as an outpatient or in the office setting under local anesthesia.<br>

</div>Your best bet is to be evaluated by board-certified plastic surgeon with a great deal of experience in breast surgery. They will be able to inform you of your options and how such a surgery will help meet your aesthetic goals. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Areolar reduction is a fairly straightforward procedure. The tradeoff is a scar which encircles the remaining areola. In certain patients, this scar can be more unsightly than the large areola. I would recommend waiting until you have had all the children you want to have.</p><p>Often times after pregnancy women have droopiness of the breasts. If you were to have a breast lift procedure, the areola reduction could be done at the same time. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Various areolar reduction options</em></p><p>Areolar reduction can be done in a number of ways. Some of these techniques also address droopy breasts. I would consider them after you have completed childbearing. Cost relates to the nature of the procedure. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Areolar reduction is usually straightforward and can be done in the office</h5><p>If you only want your areolar size reduced, this can usually be easily done in the office with local anesthetic and possible some oral sedation if you are nervous. This should not affect the feeling in the nipple areolar complex.</p><p>The quality of the skin, will be a function of the skin laxity. If it is being done as part of having your breasts reduced, then it should be done in the main OR. (David E. Berman, MD, Sterling Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Areola Reduction is often part of a Breast Lift Procedure</b></p><p>Areola Reduction is often part of a breast lift (or Mastopexy) procedure. As a woman ages, and particularly after having children, the areola expands and stretches even as the breast begins to sag and droop.<br>

</div>Most women with large areola also have sagging breasts which benefit from either a breast augmentation procedure or a breast lift procedure. If a woman needs only a small lift, I can do this simply performing a small augmentation procedure.
<p>If this woman also needs a reduction in her areola size, I can do this at the same time using a special donut technique with minimal scarring. If a woman, however, doesn’t want or require an implant, this procedure, this same donut technique can be performed as an office procedure under local anesthesia with negligible down-time. (Phillip Chang, MD, Leesburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Areola reduction can be done, but buyer beware</em></p><p>Areolar reduction is a straight-forward procedure. If you are planning on becoming pregnant soon, then I would hold off since the engorgement of the breast during pregnancy would stretch the repair.(David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Blocking suture technique for areola</em><p>Areolar reduction is safe and easy with a blocking suture. this technique yields good results with minimal scarring. However it may be wasted after pregnancy. If you want more children, I would advise waiting! (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Areolar reduction can be inexpensive</i></p><p>Areolar reduction is a form of breast lift also known as mastopexy. The concept is to reduce areolar size and tighten the skin envelope of the breast, and to adjust the nipple height in relation to the fold of the breast.</p><p>When we reduce the areolar skin alone we refer to this type of lift as a round block lift or mastopexy. The scar line runs around the nipple and is supported by a permanent suture to block and hold the nipple size, position, and shape.<br>

</div>In order to determine if the procedure is right for you place your finger in the fold under the breast. If the center of the nipple is above or perhaps one half inch below the fold, the nipple reduction or round block may work well.
<p>If the nipple is further below a full mastopexy may be required. You can still have the areolar reduction alone, its just that the overall result will be prettier with full mastopexy. Round block mastopexy, nipple reduction, is inexpensive and can be performed under local though sedation makes the experience pleasant.</p><p>The recovery is rapid with little if any down time. Comparatively, mastopexy is more expensive, and augmentation because of implant costs is more expensive yet. Is it OK before you get pregnant? Yes, though pregnancy will result in breast enlargement and areolar stresses.<br>

</div>You could breastfeed as well however all will potentially work against the result you hope will last. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Areolar reduction is a nice procedure for the right patient with the right type of breasts. Most breast reductions and breast lifts are performed along with an areolar reduction as part of the procedure. Areolar reduction, by itself, is requested on occasion, and does also produce a tightening and lifting effect to ones breasts.</p><p>An isolated areolar reduction can be performed under local anesthesia, IV sedation, or general anesthesia. It will take most surgeons between one or two hours. It is not appropriate for some patients and usually is best after childrearing is complete. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Wait until child bearing is completed before areola reduction</h4><p>This procedure can be performed in the office under local anesthesia in the right patient. Cost is not expensive. However, I would advise for you to wait until you complete your child-bearing. (Alexander M. Guba, MD, Huntersville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are planning to get pregnant relatively soon, it would make sense to wait for changes of your areola to become stable, perhaps a few months after breast-feeding your last child. One problem with areola reduction is recurrence using the periareolar lift method.</p><p>Unless you need, and have, a formal lift with a vertical scar, any immediate post-operate reduction in areolar diamension usually regresses as skin tension forces cause either gradual widening of the periareolar scar and/or stretching of the areola itself.</p><p>If the size of the areola is very unsightly to you and your plans to get pregnant are not immediate, you could certainly get a reduction now with the understanding that in the future you would probably need a repeat procedure or a more formal lift after your last pregnancy. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Short, relatively inexpensive but highly technical procedure</em></p><p>Aerolar reduction is a short and relatively inexpensive but highly technical procedure if this is what you only need. (Most of these cases have breast ptosis and need a lift as well)</p><p>If you are planning to have kids in a year or two, I would delay this procedure until you are done with pregnancy, delivery and nursing. All these will increase your breast volume and could cause recurrence. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Wait until you’re done with pregnancy before having areola reduction</em></p><p>Areola reduction is a relatively straightforward procedure that can be done under local anesthesia. I would probably wait until you are done having children before undergoing this procedure. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>An areola reduction alone is rare</strong></p><p>An areola reduction is usually associated with a breast lift and doing the areola alone would be very rare. I would suggest that you wait until you are done having children. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is always a risk of sensation loss, and loss of ability to breast feed. Add that to the fact that you are at risk for enlargement of areolas and sagging with additional pregancies, seems like this is a bit premature.</p><p>Although the cohoice is yours, If you were my patient, I would advise you to have your children, and then come in for an evaluation. You may need a lift (which will reduce teh areolas), and you may need implants as well.</p><p>It all comes down what you want, when you want it, what your prioroities are. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
