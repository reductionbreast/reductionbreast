<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Non Surgical breast reduction techniques are beginning to be marketed. The reliability and efficacy of these treatments have been questioned. Until there is more of a reliable history, you would be best to avoid. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In theory the breast can be made somewhat smaller with some of the newer non-surgical techniques that melt the fat, such as “cold lasers”, ultrasound, etc. But in reality the result would be minimal, and only in patients with fatty breasts.</p><p>In a well selected patients, meaningful breast reduction can be performed with a very specific liposuction technique. For the great majority of patients needing breast reduction only a well planned and executed surgery will achieve the desired result. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<b>No magic pill or lotion to make breasts smaller</b><p>There is NO nonsurgical way to make breasts smaller (unless you count weight loss and have breasts with a great deal of fatty component). (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Non-invasive breast reduction–NO real options</strong></p><p>Since most adult breasts are 80% fat, liposuction (which is still a surgery — although minimally invasive) is a possibility. It will reduce the size of the breasts but not lift them very much, if at all.</p><p>Weight loss might similarly help reduce breast size. Alas, these options do not deliver the results that a surgical “short scar” surgical breast reduction might deliver. (Navin K. Singh, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some have touted liposuction to make the breast smaller. One must really be the ideal candidate, (skin that will retract, no droop, etc). Even that counts as surgery, (making an incision, manipulating tissue, etc). (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Short of losing weight, there is no non-surgical breast reduction. Even with weight loss, some of my breast reduction patients told me that they had maintained their breast size. I think it depends on one’s breast fatty composition.
<p>Surgical options for breast reduction are liposuction and removing the excess breast skin and tissue. </p><p>Liposuction can be done to decrease breast size by 1 or 2 cup sizes; however, its result will depend on your breast skin elasticity and breast shape.</p><p>Your breast should start off without breast ptosis (sagginess/drooping). Removing excess breast skin and tissue are done more commonly that liposuction. It gives a very liable way to reduce breast size. Depending on the size of your breast, the scar pattern of the reduction varies. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>If you lose enough weight your breast size will probably decrease. Other than weight loss there are no non-surgical methods of breast reduction. One of the newer methods of decreasing breast side is liposuction. However, liposuction alone will not tighten the skin or change the position of the nipple. Traditional breast reductions can be performed through a variety of scar patterns. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Breast reduction without surgery</b></p><p>Some might advocate liposuction but the result would be poor because the skin envelope will be too large for the remaining skin. It is like losing weight and having a suit that is now too large.</p><p>Without a tailor, it will never fit correctly. (Gary H. Manchester, MD (retired), San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Breast Reduction without surgery is possible</h4><p></p>

</div>For some women their breasts are composed of a large percentage of fat as well as glandular breast tissue. In these cases, many women experience a decrease in their breast size when they lose weight.
<p>For other women whose breasts are primarily glandular tissues, a breast reduction surgery is needed. (Fredrick A. Valauri, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction can be used to remove some fatty tissue from a breast but liposuction is surgery with all the possible complications of any surgery. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The only way to lift and reduce is with a reduction. There are several kinds some preserve breast feeding,nearly all preserve sensation. Why not consider a short scar brazilian or french reduction? if skin toine is lipo with specila small tubes can work well. (Cap Lesesne, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Some patients may attain a significant reduction in breast size through weight loss and exercise, or by stopping hormone use. Liposuction is a fairly non-invasive method to reduce fatty breasts, and may result in significant reduction in patients with good skin tone and fatty breasts.
<p>For most patients, meaningful breast reduction requires surgery. Many new techniques include reduced scars. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction can be used to reduce breast size in a few patients who have very good skin elasticity. However, this is a rare occurrence. Other than that there is no way to reduce the breasts non surgically. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>There is no good non-surgical breast reduction</h4><p>To reduce your breasts as much as you want to and look good, you need a breast reduction which will reduce the size of the breasts, equalize asymmetries, lift the breasts, and improve breast shape.<br>

</div>Non-surgical weight loss may reduce your breast size, but the appearance will most likely be unsatisfactory. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to reduce the breasts non-surgically. Liposuction is less invasive, but does not address the excess skin and droopiness that is often involved with enlarged breasts. Breast reduction surgery allows for reduction of the size of the breasts and returning the breasts no a more attractive position.</p><p>Most patients are very happy with their results after surgery, and often say that they can’t believe they waited so long. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are some non-invasive body contouring procedures that are “still in the pipeline.” There are devices that are being used in Europe for body contouring that are not yet approved in the US that have been used instead of liposuction to reduce overall girth.<br>

</div>That be said if this product becomes available, it would most liekly reduce some of the fat content in the breast if possible. However, just like liposuctioning of the breast, there will be no control to tighten the skin envelope or raise the nipple areola complex to a “perkier” more youthful appearance.
<p>In addition, it is unclear how this could affect the long term risk of developing breast cancer . (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Non-surgical breast reduction involves weight loss</h4><p>There is no reliable non-surgical option for breast reduction – weight loss will contribute to some reduction in breast volume, but the extent of reduction is unreliable. Liposuction is a minimally invasive surgical option which is effective.</p><p>Breast reduction is an extremely effective operation – in terms of both patient satisfaction and surgical results. Ask yourself why you are not interested in this procedure. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Non surgical breast reduction does not exist.</b></p><p>A breast reduction requires surgery. Four things are generally accomplished with a breast reduction: reduction of areola diameter, reposition of the nipple and areola, reduction of volume, and removal of excess skin. Only an operation will accoomplish this. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no truly effective methods for non-surgical breast reduction. Minimally invasive reduciton can be accomplished with liposcution but this does not treat widely dospaced breasts. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There is only surgical breast reduction</h3><p>A breast reduction is a true excess skin and gland. Excision or at least liposuction is required for the correction of this excess tissue. Non surgical e.g pills or other treatments will not be enough. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction for breast reduction</h5><p>I have not seen a totally non-surgical option that works in reducing breast size. In some patients, liposuction offers a good alternative with minimal scarring. However, liposuction alone will not lift the breasts. (Dean Fardo, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Non surgical breast reduction</h4><p>Breast tissue is composed of breast parenchyma that is hormone dependent, and fat that is metabolism dependent. The latter is responsive to weight loss and breast size may decrease with weight loss. There are options for less invasive breast reduction which include liposuction alone or liposuction with short scar reduction. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Losing weight will also reduce breasts</h5><p>Losing weight tends to made breasts smaller, but they tend to droop unattractively as well with too much weight loss. It may be possible in years to come to reduce the fat content in the breasts with non-surgical options but these are in the experimental stage as of yet.</p><p>They may also lead to droopy smaller breasts. We just don’t know yet. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nothing will make your breasts smaller except removing tissue surgically.</h3><p>Liposuction only breast reduction can make the breasts smaller in the right patient, and this is scarless surgery, but it is surgery none the less. Women tend to be quite happy after breast reduction, and the recovery is fairly easy.</p><p>You just need to be motivated. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can possibly deflate the breast with liposuction if a significant percentage of the excess volume is fat rather than dense glandular tissue. But this technique doesn’t allow much shaping. In order to shape the remaining volume, you have to do surgery on the gland itself or on the skin, both of which require varying degrees of scars. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no way I know that can reduce a breast 2 cup sizes without surgery. Remember, liposuction IS surgery, not just a “procedure.” The disadvantage of liposuction exclusively for breast reduction is that the drooping of the breast is not addressed.</p><p>In a true breats reduction, the breast is not only made smaller, but it is also lifted to look more toned and youthful. Unfortunately, this requires scars, but if properly done, breast reduction patients will almost always willingly trade the benefits of the reduction (less symptoms, more attractive breast shape and size, easier clothing fit, easier to exercise…) for the scars. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Losing weight for breast reduction</h3><p>There are some patients whose breast size is directly related to their weight. So, the only non-surgical method for breast reduction would be weight loss. Other patients’ weight has no relationship with their weight. Their breast size stays the same even if they lose weight.</p><p>Those patients will benefit extremely from a breast reduction surgery. Breast reduction patients are some of the happiest due to the life changing surgery. They have less back and neck pain, they appear more proportionate, fit into clothing better and look thinner, are able to exercise better, and do not feel self conscious. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
