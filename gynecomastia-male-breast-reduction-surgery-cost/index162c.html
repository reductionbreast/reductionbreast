In my practice, the cost varies from about $3000 for very straightforward/simple cases to about $8000 for complex cases.</p><p>It is really necessary to see an experienced board certified plastic surgeon to get specific recommendations and cost estimates. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs for the surgery for reduction of the male breasts are dependent on several factors. First is one should understand there is a professional fee and a separate facility fee.</p><p>So the total cost to the patient is obtained by combining the two fees.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1915" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The professional fee varies widely. To some degree the price varies to a degree with experience and expertise however I often see patients who have seen a surgeon with little to no expertise in the area with fees significantly above our fee.</p><p>I perform surgery in three locations 1) an office operating room which is fully accredited 2) an out patient surgery center which has 4 operating rooms and 3) the hospital. The prices vary with each facility. (Jay M. Pensler, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, insurance does not typically cover this procedure. Usual cost ranges between 4500-6500 depending on the extent of surgery needed.

</div><p>Every patient is unique, which its why a consultation is adamant to determine the exact price of surgery and how long it will take. The average price at my clinic is $5000 (this fee may vary), some insurance companies may cover the expenses, i would inquire with them before making any commitments. (Omar Fouda Neel, MD, FRCSC, FACS, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i> Will insurance cover gynecomastia male breast reduction </i></p><p>Gynecomastia surgery is only covered by insurance if there is a medical cause for the gynecomastia. This is almost never the case. </p><p>A medical case is usually discovered by your primary care physician, and would involve doing multiple tests on you to determine that there is some underlying issue resulting in the formation of breast tissue, including medications, drugs, hormone abnormality, cancer, or other medical condition.</p><p>If there is an underlying medical condition, it has to be addressed first, and then the gynecomastia can be surgically treated. If there is no underlying medical cause, this is considered cosmetic surgery. Cost is in the range of $6000 +/- $1000, depending on the technique that is required. This is determined during a consultation and examination.

</div><p>There are many key factors determining the cost of a male breast reduction. On average a male breast reduction procedure can typically cost anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000, depending on the techniques used and the level of anesthesia requiredLiposuction, direct excision of the glandular tissue and the removal of any excess skin will effect pricing.</p><p>Surgical specimens sent for pathology will add additional costs. Portions of your procedure may be covered by your insurance. </p><p>The first step is to determine whether or not you have true glandular Gynecomastia or if you just have excess fat and skin.</p><p>If you are in good health with no medical problems your male breast reduction procedures may be performed in the doctors office either with IV sedation or even local tumescent anesthesia. </p><p>Be certain to discuss all your options and explore your individual possibilities carefully with your Surgeon.

</ol><p>The cost of gynecomastia depends on surgeon expertise, degree of gynecomastia, technique, what kind of anesthesia, etc. Virtually every case I do includes liposuction and glandular excision under general anesthesia. The average case I perform costs over $7,000. (Tim Neavin, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Male breast reduction be performed by liposuction, glandular excision, or excision of the skin, fat and skin. The patients anatomy determines which operation is appropriate. </p><p>The cost of the surgery varies from around $4000 to $7500 depending on which approach is chosen. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice, male breast reduction typically costs $4,000 to $5,000. If significant skin resection is needed, it would effect the cost of the surgery. Insurance typically does not cover this surgery in most cases.

Also, fees vary significantly based on what part of the country and what type of physician is performing the surgery.</p><p>The average cost for male breast reduction according to a 2016 survey by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons was $3,196. </p><p>The type of surgery, anesthesia and facility were not mentioned however. That number is quite a bit lower than those being reported by many RealSelf male breast reduction patients, which is often between $5000 and $7000.</p><p>The cost of compression garments, lab tests and prescriptions are often required not included in these reported prices. With regard to insurance, male breast reduction surgery will not be covered unless some level of medical necessity can be proven.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1921" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Symptoms such as intertriginous rashes in the inframammary fold area, neck, shoulder and back strain and pain are commonly used as medical justification for female breast reduction, but would not apply in most cases of gynecomastia.</p><p>One other factor that might be considered is the negative effect of gynecomastia on your mental health. Check with your insurance company though, since they usually vary significantly from one insurance company to another. (David F. Pratt, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Insurance coverage for gynecomastia surgery</h5><p>Some insurance carriers specifically exclude the word “gynecomastia” from their insurance plans. Others cover the cost of just simply removing the glandular breast tissue, without covering the cost of liposuction to sculpt the area.</p><p>In my experience, if a surgeon just simply removes the breast tissue directly, without additional sculpting, there can be a significant aesthetic deformity leading to a divoted chest. The price of liposuction to the chest area, in California, ranges from about $6,000 to $10,000.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1922" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</ol><p>Generally speaking, insurance does not cover the cost of your procedure because it is usually for aesthetic rather than therapeutic benefit.</p><p>However, you should ask your insurance provider as they may be different. In Toronto, Ontario, the cost of the procedure ranges from $4000-$6000. Financing options are available.

</div><h3>Male Breast Reduction in the Midwest, US: $3,500-$6,000</h3><p>The price of male breast reduction surgery is variable and depends on multiple factors. In some cases the procedure may be covered by insurance, while in others, it may be viewed as strictly cosmetic and therefore not covered.</p><p>Insurance companies often cover gynecomastia treatment when excision of breast tissue is performed. When liposuction is used as the primary method of treatment insurance coverage is far less likely. Coverage is more likely when breast development occurs secondary to medical problems, medical treatments or hormonal imbalances.</p><p>In addition, when patients have functional impairment or pain within the breast, coverage is more likely. Recently, we have seen more and more insurance companies not covering male breast reduction surgery or denying its medical necessity.</p><p>When this happens the procedure can still be performed as a cosmetic procedure. The charges associated with cosmetic male breast reduction include the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, facility fee and pathology charges. This usually totals between $3500 and $6000 in the Midwestern United States and depends on the method of treatment chosen.</p><p>The incidence of self-pay male breast reduction appears to be increasing as more insurance companies deny coverage of this procedure. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Gynecomastia surgery cost</h3><p>The cost of gynecomastia surgery varies dependent on the severity of gynecomastia. I separate the surgery into three groups. The majority of times the breast tissue and fat can be removed without the removal of any skin, The second type is when a small strip of skin is removed from around the areola.</p><p>The final type is the most severe and requires a large amount of skin to be removed and the nipple moved. The costs for these range from around $5000 – $9000 total (fees for surgeon, facility, and anesthesia).</p><p>Insurance rarely covers the cost and in my experience only when the gynecomastia has been caused by a specific brain tumor. Even then there is usually a component of the surgery which is cosmetic in order to leave you with a smooth natural appearance. (Ronald Schuster, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
