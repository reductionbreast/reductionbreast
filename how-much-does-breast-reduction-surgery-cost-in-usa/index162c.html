S. for breast reduction, including anesthesia, is just under $6,000. </p><p>Today, many plastic surgeons offer options for financing and may also work with your insurance provider so you don’t have to.</p><p>The best way to know for sure how much you can expect to pay is by visiting a board-certified plastic surgeon for a consultation!(Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>The total cost of a cosmetic breast reduction at my clinic is $5000-7000 dollars. Remember, most insurance plans will cover the cost of a breast reduction if a patient presents with signs and symptoms of neck pain, back pain, shoulder grooving and rashes underneath the breast.
<p>Additionally, if the patients daily activities of living are limited by the large size of the breast the insurance is more likely to cover the procedure. For those patients who do not have insurance the cost of a breast reduction is variable.</p><p>It depends on the extent of surgery to be performed on the breast. For example, a smaller breast will require less surgery. </p><p>A very large breast is going to require more extensive surgical treatment. One must consider the cost of the facility, the cost of anesthesia, the cost of postoperative garments, and the cost of preoperative testing, and the cost of prescription medications.</p><p>Another consideration is liposuction of the lateral folds of the chest wall which definitely complements the postoperative result of the breast reduction. Actual total fees can range from $6000-$12,000. A total fee of $9,000 is not unreasonable, when considering total reshaping of the breast. (James Fernau, MD, FACS, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Breast Reduction can be a complex surgery, and with any complex surgery, the cost can be higher than for other things such as breast implant surgery. 
<p>The reason for the complexity is that the breasts have to be reshaped, the nipples have to be moved and the two breast have to be made to look even.</p><p>The complexity is increased when the patient begins with two different breast sizes and niplles are off center and at different locations. Typical cost in my practice is $9500 – $20,000 depending on what is needed. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast reduction has one of the highest satisfaction rates seen in plastic surgery. In most cases, this procedure has been covered by insurance carriers. </p><p>Recently, we have seen more and more insurance companies not covering breast reduction surgery or denying its medical necessity. When this happens the procedure can still be performed as a cosmetic procedure.<br>

</div>The charges associated with cosmetic breast reduction include the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, facility fee, and pathology reports. This usually totals between $8,000 and $12,000 in the Midwestern United States.
<p>It’s important to clarify the situation with your insurance carrier prior to proceeding, since they generally will not cover the procedure after the fact. The incidence of self-pay breast reduction appears to be increasing dramatically. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If not covered in your insurance policy the insurance companies will not pay….a lot of policies specifically state this in their policy statements.</p><p>Total costs nationwide run from about $5000 – $20000. The cost does not reflect the quality of surgeons technique either.</p><p>Find several doctors in your area and consult with them and find your comfort zone with the Doc and his staff, look at photos, evaluate his experience , ask for referrals if necessary or unsure. I know this is one of the most rewarding procedures I can offer my patients as I see how much it changes peoples lives after living with the pain and sometimes humiliation and therefore I make it affordable to my clients by offering a total surgical package at the lower end of the the nationwide range.<br>

</div>Financing is available for patients nationwide also. (David Liland, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Costs for surgery depend partly on region. If insurance doesn’t cover your breast reduction, then it is simply cosmetic surgery. In my region, this is approximately $6000-$9000. Costs include the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, and facility fee.</p><p>Lab tests and prescriptions are not included but are usually covered by insurance. (Orna Fisher, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In many instances breast reduction is covered by health insurance. You need to have a consultation, after which the plastic surgeon will request authorization from your insurance company to perform your Beast Reduction. In my practice if a patient does not have insurance the cost of a breast reduction including operating room, anesthesia and surgery is $9,500. (Fred Suess, MD (retired), San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>In Ohio, the surgeon’s fee tends to be somewhere in the $4000-5000 range. This does not include the OR time and cost for anesthesia. Both of these are billed by time, so it depends on how long the surgery takes.
<p>At the Lake Health system in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, the cost would be an additional $2890 for a 4 hour operation. So the total would be $7000-8000. (Jennifer Greer, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Costs Vary by Region</strong></p><p>Breast reduction costs in USA vary according to each region of the country. In the NYC region, where I practice, costs, including anesthesia, facility fees, and physician fees, can vary from $8,000 to $12,000.</p><p>Consult with surgeons in your area to find out local prices.

<p>Prices for any plastic surgery vary depending on the patient and their specific needs. Your plastic surgeon will give you various options that will help your case, maybe a breast reduction and implants, maybe just a breast reduction, maybe a reduction with a lift.</p><p>All these options you would need to see with your PS overall to see what would be your best option. Prices can vary between 2,000 dlls to 5,000 dlls. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>It depends on the surgeon, your location and the size of the reduction. </h5><p>It is ill-advised for any surgeon to give a quote without an examination as there are several components to this answer. The Surgeon performing the operation, their experience and demand will influence the fee they charge for this procedure.<br>

</div>Other factors include the size of the reduction which may be the greatest variable if someone is a G or J cup (very large reduction) the extra time necessary to perform such a large reduction will definitely add to the cost, and by the same logic a D or DD (smaller reduction) would typically be less expensive.
<p>If you are in NYC it may be much more expensive than in a small town in rural NY. That being said the range throughout the country would likely be $7000-25000 for OR/Anesthesia and surgeons fee. (Joseph B. Eby, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fees for breast reduction will vary depending upon what part of the country you live. Most facilities offer flat rates for prepaid surgeries which are much cheaper than standard operating fees. In San Antonio area you can obtain a breast reduction for as low as around $6000.<br>

</div>Also, there are companies like Care Credit that make the surgery more affordable. You can discuss this with your plastic surgeon. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Breast reduction is covered by insurance many times. If you do not have insurance or do not qualify for an insurance breast reduction, the surgery can be performed as a cosmetic procedure. </p><p>There are some advantages to performing the procedure a cosmetically, as most insurance company policies have minimum amounts that must be removed.</p><p>Doing the procedure cosmetically, gives your surgeon the ability to sculpt your breast to the size you would like regardless of how much tissue they remove. Breast reduction surgery cost can vary significantly with geographic location.</p><p>The typical cost for surgeon, anesthesia and facility (hospital or surgery center) is between $5,000 and $8,000. Consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to get an exact quote. (Ralph Trey Aquadro, MD, Auburn Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Breast reduction is sometimes covered by insurance in whole or in part. If patients pay for the surgery themselves before the operation, total costs are typically $10,000-$15,000 depending on the size and adjacent issues. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)
<p>There are a few factors that contribute to the costs of a reduction in USA. If a true reduction is necessary, the cost is $7000-$8000 at our facility in Raleigh. That typically includes liposuction to the lateral chest wall which I have found to significantly improve the end result and appearance.</p><p>Cost is certainly important but the quality of the surgeon, staff and facility can all vary dramatically. </p><p>I would encourage anyone considering this surgery to seek a couple of opinions. Find someone who can provide more than one or two types of breast reduction and who can match your procedure to your body.<br>

</div>A thousand dollars more or less is a lot of money but there can be a lot of value in high end offices and facilities that, simply, offer higher levels of quality and care. More is not always better, however, and that’s why seeking multiple opinions has value. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Depending on the amount of breast to be removed, the procedure may possibly be covered by insurance. In instances where it is not, the cost will ultimately be driven by the amount that needs to be removed. (Asaad H. Samra, MD, New Jersey Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs vary based on the location you are having the surgery as well as the amount of tissue that needs to be removed. Including anesthesia and operating room costs you should be between 8-10K. (Rick Rosen, MD, Norwalk Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price of Bilateral Breast reduction</h3><p>A Breast reduction can start from 12,000 and up depending on location of MD. Some insurance companies will cover a bilateral breast reduction depending on size and amount of breast tissue removed. (Norman M. Rowe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast reduction in our practice ranges between $7200 and $7800 depending on the type of implants used. Also prices may vary depending on the city you live and the Doctor performing your surgery. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast reduction costs can vary widely. The main determinant is whether you have private health insurance in Australia. For my patients who do not, I encourage them to take out insurance as it is a significant cost saving.</p><p>In my practice, if you have private health insurance, your cost averages AUD$6500. This includes all your consultation, surgeon, anaesthetist, and assistant’s fees plus garments as required and your hospitalisation in a fully accredited private hospital facility.
