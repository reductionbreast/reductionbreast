<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Breast reduction at an early age takes careful thought</h3><p>Breast reduction is a safe procedure at any age, however best results and satisfaction can swing on two very important issues, physical maturity, and emotional maturity. The breast can continue to enlarge and develop into an individuals early twenties.</p><p>By age 17 the chance of further breast enlargement is small but can happen. In a focused individual who suffers from physical limitation, or in an athletically gifted individual that you mention breast reduction can certainly improve performance and may be important to consider at an early age. This may be important in other areas of athletics as well such as swimming or in dance.</p><p>The second consideration is emotional maturity as with breast reduction there are certain trade-offs which cannot be reversed once the reduction is complete.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_737" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A large breast can be emotionally challenging for a young woman as we are a body conscience society. Still, after reduction two facts must be understood. First, the breast will lactate with pregnancy but successful breast feeding without supplementation is unlikely.</p><p>At age 17 it can be difficult to understand feelings about an issue so far in the future. Second, there will be a scar on the breast and nipple. With short scar reduction the scar is lessened though again at age 17 it may be more difficult to understand your feeling concerning your body and scar with friends or in dating and intimacy (hopefully also in the future).</p><p>In my practice when I see young individuals I ask them to consider all the issues carefully. It may be unlikely that their desire for reduction will go away, but it may help them plan a “best time” in their life.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_738" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some will forge ahead with plans for reduction. At age 17 I suggest that you consider your choice for a year.</p><p>If you plan on reduction a convenient time is just after your senior year, giving a summer to recover and relax, and a fresh start with new friends and challenges with college in the fall. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Age is only one factor</h3><p>Age does not automatically make someone a candidate or make someone not a candidate. It is only one factor to consider.</p><p>If at 17 y.o. you have fully developed breasts which has not changed for the last two years or so, you are mature enough to understand the risks and recovery involved and are medically healthy enough to undergo the surgery, then you are a good candidate.</p><p>Breast reduction is the ultimate in combining reconstructive and cosmetic elements of plastic surgery. Patients are extremely happy as long as they understand what is involved. Obviously not being an adult officially, a 17y.o. would need parents available during any consultation and to give consent for surgery. Seek out a board certified plastic surgeon who has a good reputation in your area and go over the surgery with them.

</div><p>17 is young, but not too young. I don’t agree that it is drastic. When appropriate, it just the right thing. Very large breasts can cause social, physical, and emotional problems that can be severe.</p><p>Although there are a lot of scars, they fade nicely over time, and overwhelmingly, women who have this procedure are among the most happy and satisfied with the outcome. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Appropriate age for breast reduction surgery</h3><p>There are a number of factors to consider when contemplating breast reduction surgery in a younger patient.</p><p>In my practice it is not uncommon to have a patient undergo breast reduction in their teens.</p><p>One of the important factors to consider is how many years has the patient had macromastia, and for how long has the breast size been stable.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_740" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some other factors are social ostracism, degree of symptoms from heavy breasts etc.</p><p>This type of a decision is not taken lightly, but in a right patient breast reduction surgery in a younger patient is an appropriate decision. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Balance risks and benefits for best patient outcome</h4><p>Seventeen would be an age less than most, but not inappropriate, if other factors are right. Breast growth should have ceased.</p><p>The goal should be treatment of functional problems such as back, neck and shoulder pain, posture problems, interference with activities, etc.</p><p>In addition, a surgeon would want to assess the motivation and level of emotional maturity of the patient. The surgery wouldn’t be considered drastic in the patient who stands to benefit greatly. The risks would be similar to other patients.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_741" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Discussion would normally include future breast feeding, changes with pregnancy, initial activity limitations, etc. (Sutton Graham II, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>17 is NOT too young.</strong></p><p>I have done thousands of breast reductions and I have done woment from 14 to 88 years old. Many woment have breast reductions before going off to college. They are usually 17 or 18 yrs old and they want to arrive at their new school with their new sporty figure.</p><p>We have many teen age women who are happy to speak with prospective patients who are considering this surgery. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Need to separate Functional from Cosmetic reasons for surgery</h4><p>You really need to separate functional from cosmetic reasons for having surgery. Age should not be a limiting factor in the decision making. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_742" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>17 is not too young for breast reduction if growth has reached a plateau</h4><p>The most important factor is probably the growth curve and not necessarily the chronological age. If the patient has reached a plateau and has demonstrated little if any growth over the preceeding 6 months, than I would not feel that a breast reduction is cointra-indicated.</p><p>Of course the risks are overcorrection or undercorrection, with the former being more likely. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Is there a correct age for breast reduction surgery?</h5><p>Although age needs to be considered, it should never be the determining factor in in performing this FUNCTIONAL proceedure. The risks of NOT performing the surgery in a young patient are:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_743" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2bf4d68df5193fb91b84fa6c8f88ee0a">

If the breasts are so large that they are interfering with activities such as sports, then the surgery should be considered.

</div><p>Also there are scars and these scars are permanent. The scars are around the areola, extending straight down to the bottom of the breast and under the breast. There is a lot which can be done to help the scars be as minimal as possible such as making a short scar under the breast as well as things that can be done while the scars are healing to try and make the scars less visible. (Susan E. Downey, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>It is too young if breasts are still growing.</strong></p><p>If a 17 year old girl has uncomfortably large breasts, and her breasts have NOT CHANGED FOR TWO YEARS, and she is emotionally mature and well motivated, then it is perfectly OK for her to have a breast reduction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_745" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>She will benefit. But many teenagers’ breasts are still growng. Then surgery should be put off, or it may have to be done again. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>17 is not too young if the patient has reached full adult size or the breasts are extremely large in the case of gigantomastia. It also depends upon the maturity level of the patient, the underlying medical conditions, and the reasons for surgery. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>17 is not to young if the patients breast cause them problems with neck and back ache, difficulty with dressing, difficulty with activities especially sports. Other reasons may be sever asymmetry or a significant self consciousness.</p><p></p>

</div>It is possible that the patient may continue to grow but this is unlikely. I certainly can appreciate the desire of this top quality athlete to want to improve her body proportions so that she could perform better. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>Every case is different</h4><p>Every patient should be looked at individually in terms of what their motivation is as well as their exam. Having said this, there are 18 year olds who will not be mature enough to understand the ramifications of the surgery and should wait.</p><p>The most important aspect is a non-hurried and comprehensive consultation to educate the patient as much as possible about this surgery and haw it may affect their future.

</div>Many patients who over-develop early can benefit from breast reduction surgery. The risks for a younger patient are not too different from the older patient.
<p>Patients need to be aware of possible loss of nipple sensation, infections, bleeding, hypertrophic scarring, and most notably for younger patients, potential inability to breast feed.</p><p>Most patients seem very happy with their new shape and size. (Scott Tucker, MD, Winston Salem Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Not if the patient is symptomatic</strong></p><p>Juvenile breast hypertrophy, or “large breasts in a teenager”, can cause a multiitude of ophysical complaints, as well as some emotional/social issues. It is certainly appropriate to consider breast reduction in these patients if the benefits outweigh the risks.</p><p>In other words, if the symptoms are severe enough that the patient is willing to risk the possibility of another surgery in the future if the breast are still growing, along with all the other risks associated with breast reduction surgery, then the surgery is warranted. (W. Tracy Hankins, MD, Henderson Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Is 17 Too Young for Breast Reduction Surgery</h5><p>17 is not too young for a breast reduction if you are symptomatic. Symptoms of macromastia include neck and back pain, shoulder grooving, and intertriginous rashes or dermatitis. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
