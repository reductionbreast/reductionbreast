<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>A Breast Reduction always includes a component of lifting the breast. Generally, large breasts stretch the skin of the breasts due to the effect of gravity, causing the breasts to elongate in a downward direction.</p><p>Also, the areola usually enlarges proportionately to the enlargement of the breast. As a result, the nipple tends to be below the actual fold beneath the breast, and the areola is too large. </p><p>A Breast Reduction elevates the nipple to the proper position on the reduced, smaller breast mound, and makes the areola proportionately smaller as well, no matter which technique is used.</p><p>Breast Reduction makes breasts smaller, higher, and better. (Athleo Louis Cambre, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>They are usually the same thing but not always</b><br>

</div>Most of the time they are essentially the same thing, though the specific type of lift may be determined in part by how much of a reduction is done, and vice-versa. 
<p>The minimal scar techniques often work better with smaller reductions and where there is less sagging.</p><p>Occasionally, there is no sagging and only a small amount of reduction is desired, so doing only liposuction may be an option, though that is not very common. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both procedures are typically done through the same incisions. A breast reduction, if planned properly, will also give you a lifted breast as well. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction alone will not give you a lift after surgery. If you do need both procedures, they will be performed together. Consulting in person with a board certified plastic surgeon will give you a better idea of what type of surgery is best for you. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Breast Reduction Includes a Breast Lift</strong><p>Breast reduction surgery in general implies a breast lift at the same time. There are some techniques such as liposuction reduction, which would reduce the volume of the breast without addressing loose skin. However, the vast majority of the patients with large breasts also have drooping issues at the same time.</p><p>When I do breast reduction surgery I maintain the nipple and areola on the underlying breast tissue, which normally is from the upper middle part of the breast where fullness is most important. </p><p>I remove unnecessary excess tissue from the lower and outer portion of the breast and the remaining breast tissue with the nipple still connected is rotated up and in, in order to provide fullness in the cleavage area and raise the breast into a higher position and then the excess skin is removed and tightened.<br>

</div>Generally, with breast reduction surgery the final scar pattern would be a circle scar around the areola and a line going down the breast with possibly a scar underneath the breast as well. Breast lifts do not require tissue removal as you can simply lift the tissue that is there and rearrange it.
<p>In patients where they need a lift that do not have enough tissue, fat grafting or the addition of implants can help to provide for more volume. (Robert Cohen, MD, Santa Monica Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Breast Reduction Includes Lift. No Extra Charge!!</em></p><p>Every breast reduction includes elevation of the nipple and positioning of the gland higher on the chest wall. Translation: Every breast reduction includes breast lift (mastopexy), no extra charge! (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>A breast reduction is done to decrease the size of the breast. During this procedure the nipple and underlying supportive breast tissue is repositioned to improve the appearance of the breast which usually entails lifting the breast as well.
<p>Depending on your specific goals and anatomy, the procedure should be tailored to accommodate those. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>One of the best things about a breast reduction is the fact that it includes a simultaneous breast lift. </h3><p>As part of a typical breast reduction procedure, the breast is also lifted to give a full and “perky” look. In fact, most patients are very satisfied with breast reduction surgery because in addition to better functioning without carrying the extra weight on the necks, shoulders, and backs, they look better too.<br>

</div>Add the fact that most patients find it easier (and more confortable socially) to exercise after breast reduction surgery and you can see why it is such a popular operation… (Michael H. Rosenberg, MD, Mount Kisco Plastic Surgeon)
<p>You can lift your breast without reducing them but it is difficult to reduce the breasts without lifting them. Most women with large breasts desire a reduction as well as a lift so that their breasts do not rest on their tummy and so that they have a nicer shape.</p><p>Lifting the breasts functions like an internal bra and takes the strain off the neck and shoulders. Some surgeons will use liposuction to reduce the volume of the breasts but this will give a minimal lift.</p><p>Be sure to consult with a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Laurence Kirwan, MD, FRCS, FACS, Norwalk Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Most procedures that reduce the breast are designed to lift the breast at the same time. Your breast is actually much ‘looser’ once it is reduced so the lift portion is essential. (Scott E. Newman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>A breast reduction IS a lift. The incisions that are made for both procedures are the same; in fact, it is very difficult to perform a reduction without lifting the breast. (Allen M. Doezie, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>All breast reductions are automatically breast lifts. However, just a breast lift (mastopexy) does not reduce breast size significantly. </p><p>Which one you need depends on the goals of the surgery, eg neck pain and rashes due to heavy breasts versus sagging deflated breasts that wish were tighter and prettier.<br>

</div>The goals are very different and the techniques can be too. For example, lifts are often done in combination with implants. This would not be done for someone who needs a breast reduction. You will need to consult with a plastic surgeon to determine what is right for you. (Orna Fisher, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)
<p>In a breast lift, only skin is removed. By removing the skin the breast can be pushed upward and tightened. When a breast reduction is performed the surgeon removes excess skin, but actual breast tissue is also removed so the patient has both a lifted breast that is also smaller.</p><p>All in all with a breast reduction you will automatically also get a lift. Be sure to see a board certified plastic surgeon for consultation. (Shain A. Cuber, MD, Edison Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<b>Breast Reduction Includes a Lift</b><p>A breast reduction not only reduces the size of the breasts but also commonly repositions the breasts back up on the chest wall. A reduction normally also reduces the size of the nipple area and repositions it up on the chest/breast where it belongs for an attractive, pretty cosmetic result.</p><p>In many respects this operation is similar to a breast lift. The primary difference is that in a breast lift, there is no breast tissue removed so the breasts retain the same volume. If you are pleased with the size of your breasts, a lift (mastopexy) may be all that you need.</p><p>If you also want the breasts to be smaller, then a breast reduction is needed. Seek the consultation of a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. They have a website listing all the certified plastic surgeons.<br>

<p><strong>Combination breast lift & reduction.</strong></p><p>Breast lift is, essentially, the same operation as breast reduction but without the excision of excess breast tissue. It is a significantly less aggressive procedure and its’ recovery is similarly less arduous. There are numerous different types of breast reduction and breast lift procedures that can be done for different patients.</p><p>Your own particular circumstances will, of course, be taken into consideration by your Plastic Surgeon. (Steven M. Gitt, MD, FACS (in memoriam), Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Large breast tend to sag and droop over time. This can cause back and shoulder pain, which is one of the most common reasons why women look into having their breast reduced. When reducing the size, your plastic surgeon will be giving you the best anatomical positioning of your breast.<br>

</div>This positioning is related to specific guidelines and measurements that are recommended by the board of plastic surgery, to provide the best look, as well as, having a more comfortable and pleasing outcome. In general a lift is part of the procedure adding to a more aesthetically pleasing breast position and shape.
<p>Not all insurance plans cover this procedure, however, financing is available. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon) </p><p>As a result of breast reduction you will also experience a lifting of the breasts. It is a “included” result of a breast reduction. The incisions are very similar. (Fred Suess, MD (retired), San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction will reduce AND lift the breast. A pure breast lift (mastopexy) will lift the breast but not reduce the size. (Awf Quaba, MB, ChB, FRCS, Edinburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction includes a lift. The lift repositions the nipple, reshapes the breast and removes excess skin. The main difference between a lift and a reduction is the size. If you want to go smaller, tissue can be removed. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Both Breast Lift and Reduction Result in Perky Breast</h3><p>If you want smaller lifted breasts then a breast reduction is indicated. If you just want lifted breasts then a breast lift (mastopexy) is required. Both procedures will leave you with a perky result. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction does include making the breast smaller, and lifting and reshaping the breast. Should you try liposuction for a breast reduction, you may not achieve much lift. A breast lift removes the excess skin and lifts the breasts.</p><p>some women will be a little smaller in just removing excessive sagging skin. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Breast Reduction and a Lift Achieve the Same End Goal</h5><p>A lift is included in a breast reduction and, when done with a vertical or similar technique, rather than with an anchor scar, the shape can be vastly improved as well.</p><p>The breast with this technique tends to be fuller and more projecting without a bra. Find a surgeon and an office that you like and make certain that your surgeon does a number of different kinds of reduction so that the end result matches your body.
