<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Size of scar will depend on how small you would like your breast size to be. A breast reduction is much different than a breast lift. If you only lift the nipple versus doing a vertical lift, the appearance of the breast may be unattractive depending on your breast shape.</p><p>If you do get a breast reduction, to reduce the appearance of scarring, you should avoid smoking, tanning and keep a healthy diet. Also apply any ointments given by your surgeon. </p><p>Breast reduction scars may be optimized with an excellent surgical technique, but your genetics are still very important in determining your outcome. </p><p>Ask to see lost of pictures of your surgeon’s work to determine what is realistic for you.<br>

</div>Finding the proper surgeon who performs reductions frequently is usually a good place to start on minimizing the scarring. 
<p>Postoperatively silicone gel products and if needed laser treatments can minimize the scars as well.  No surgery can be done without scarring, but it is possible to limit your scarring and avoid the long underneath scar. </p><p>Also, we have some excellent scar products that you can use as soon as all the tapes are removed.</p><p>I do feel you would be much happier with a smaller size, and have much less neck and shoulder pain, and find it easier to shop. I my experience, most women are so excited about their new size and shape, that they are willing to have scars. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>I typically ask my patient if she wants to have the best looking breast possible? Obviously, that is the goal of all patients.
<p>The problems that women with overly large breasts must deal with are those of excess breast tissue, of excess skin in the vertical dimension, of excess skin in the transverse (horizontal) plane, and of breast droop/sag.</p><p>In order to achieve the best possible outcome, we must take all 4 of these issues into consideration in our surgical planning. In order to elevate the nipple and to remove excess skin in the vertical plane, we must have a scar around the nipple and extending to the infra-mammary crease.</p><p>In order to remove the excess skin in the transverse/horizontal plane, we must have an incision in the infra-mammary crease. Taking those considerations into account, we can formulate our surgical plan. (Steven M. Gitt, MD, FACS (in memoriam), Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Depending on the technique used for your reduction, your skin complexion, the incisions and thus the scarring may well be much less than you anticipate. If you left your breasts large and just had them lifted, (need incisions) they would only sag again over time. (Fred Suess, MD (retired), San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Most patients do not want scars but realize the tradeoff is definitely worth them as relief of the daily neck, shoulder and back pain is so life changing. Also to fit into clothes better and look more lean is a benefit too.</p><p>Post op management can reduce scars such as silicon sheets along incisions for up to a year. They are easily ordered on line for reasonable prices. Smaller breast like C or D cups can be reduced with different techniques that have less scars….for people that want to be a B or C cup. Yes people do request this but it is rare and considered strictly cosmetic. (David Liland, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<strong>Breast Reduction without scarring</strong><p>There are many, many ways to do a breast reduction. The smallest amount of scarring is with liposuction alone. Liposuction can provide dramatic improvements but the surgeons control over the end appearance and the end position of the nipple is lower than in any other reduction.</p><p>Adding scars around the areola and down the lower half of the front of the breast (lollipop incision) can dramatically change the shape and size of the breast while matching it to your body. I see women in their 50’s and 60’s who have wanted breast reduction all their lives but thought that it wasn’t safe or that the scars were too noticeable to have the surgery at a younger age.</p><p>To a person they all regret waiting as long as they did. Take some time to find a good plastic surgeon who does multiple variations of a breast reduction and who can match the procedure to your body. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Breast reduction – minimising scars</h4><p>All breast reductions apart from liposuction leave scars, but it is only a small percentage of patients who have reql problems with scars. Usually the scars are just red for 2 months or so, and taping scars for 3-4 months with silicone sheets reduces the chance of problem scars.</p><p>If the scars are starting to thicken at 6 weeks the the medical grade </p><p>Fraxel restore DUAL laser is the best laser to help minimise the scarring. Liposuction does work for breast reduction if you are young with good skin tone and no sag to your breasts, with a reduction of 1-2 cups sizes possible.</p><p>If you do not fulfill all these criteria then you just end up with smaller breasts with more sag (Charles Cope, MD, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Breast Reduction Includes Breast Lift; Surgical Techniques, Pressure, Massage & Topical Agents Help Minimize Scarring</h4><p>The majority of patients who have breast enlargement also have breast sag. Breast reduction surgery not only reduces the size of the breasts, but also reduces areola size and lifts the breasts into normal position.</p><p>This requires removal of excess skin in both the transverse and vertical dimensions with resultant surgical incisions. Scarring is inevitable when this approach is utilized. Efforts to minimize scarring with meticulous surgical technique, pressure, massage, and topical agents can be helpful.</p><p>Occasionally, scar revisions may be necessary at a later date. It’s important to realize that wound healing goes on for over a year and that the scarring continues to improve during this period. Ultimately, the majority of patients are extremely happy with the aesthetic result of breast reduction surgery even when scarring is present.</p><p>Before proceeding with breast reduction, you should be comfortable with this issue. A consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon where this issue is thoroughly discussed might be helpful. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best way to avoid scarring is to pick a board certified Plastic Surgeon and has a consultation. At the consultation you will review photographs of previous patients and see the healed incisions of the surgeon.</p><p>Sometimes patients have a tendency to have hypertrophic scars or keloids and this may be related to Mediterranean ancestry. But sometimes it is the result of precise non-tension closure, technique, and suture choice by the surgeon. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is a relatively uncommon breast reduction technique called liposuction reduction which has minimal scars. This technique is good for patients seeking a reduction who have large but perky breasts with a significant fat content.</p><p>Scarring is minimal, but this technique does not lift the breasts, and is not effective for patients with a lot of glandular (firm) breast tissue. Unfortunately, if your breasts are starting to sag, this “scarless” breast reduction would possibly make your breasts droopier as they would lose volume without tightening the skin envelope.</p><p>Also, if your breasts stay the same size after weight loss, it is likely they have a higher glandular tissue component with less fat, also making you a poor option for liposuction breast reduction. In general, breast reduction or breast lift surgeries create some type of scar, but in most cases the scars fade nicely over time and are a small tradeoff for the vastly improved breast shape and size, as well as improvement in back, neck and shoulder pain.</p><p>Fortunately for my patients, I have spent years training with leading innovators in the area of breast reduction surgery. Much of my training focused on minimizing scars through the use of meticulous technique and under-the-skin dissolving sutures (to avoid stitch marks), and implementing the vertical or “Lejour” technique (to avoid a scar under the breast in certain patients).</p><p>All of these techniques help improve scars in ways that the traditional anchor shaped incision with external stitches or staples cannot. (Robert Cohen, MD, Santa Monica Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no way to avoid scarring in a breast reduction. A lot will depend on what type of procedure you have, and size of breasts. Most people do not complain about breast reduction scars because they are so happy with the lack of symptoms due to removal of large breasts. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Optimizing your results</i></p><p>All plastic surgeons would love to do “scarless” surgery, but it is sadly not possible. We all try to minimize your incisions. To optimally shape your breast,you will have some scars as noted below and in the “wise ” pattern configuration.</p><p>remember,most scars can be revised and very quickly and simply. The pedicle, and the dissection will be important. The results,if you are like most, will lead to weight losss, improved exercise tolerance ,better posture and and improved self esteem.
