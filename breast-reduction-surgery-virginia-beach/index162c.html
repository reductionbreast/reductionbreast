Breast surgery accounted for a significant part of the cosmetic surgery since its inception.</p><p>These operations, especially for breast augmentation, attract more media attention than all other types of aesthetic surgery.</p><p>This is a lot written about, and, unfortunately, not always objectively. Our goal is to correct some misconceptions.</p><p>These two different operations on the chest are described in one article, because the procedures, risks and results are the same.</p><p>The main difference is that with a breast lift, the incision is usually shorter and only the skin and a little fat are removed, while with a reduction in the breast, a glandular tissue with an adjacent fat is also removed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6932" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0d132e35601b710a7310d0542ab4ea50">

</div><p>Sometimes a breast lift is combined with breast augmentation to give the upper chest a fullness and a better shape. The enlarged chest looks more round and younger than the naturally larger one.</p><p>Problems in patients are also somewhat different. Women with large, heavy breasts complain of pain in the back, neck and shoulders, numbness of hands, headaches, the fact that the bra straps cut into the shoulders or to rub and irritate the skin in the crease under the breast.</p><p>Women with large breasts are more likely to have violations of the menstrual cycle and some types of physical activity. According to studies, in women after breast reduction, breast cancer is less likely to develop. It is easier to examine during mammograms.</p><p>A sluggish, sagging bust can be the result of the bearing and feeding of children or the result of a significant weight loss. A certain role is played also by hereditary factors. In addition, the breast deforms with age.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6933" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The first real attempt to reduce the breasts was undertaken in 1897 by a doctor named Michel Poussin. Since then, many methods and modifications have been proposed, and the safest and most aesthetically advantageous ones have been identified and developed.</p><p>Currently, breast surgery is the usual and most often required procedures in the whole world.</p><p>Both after reduction, and after breast augmentation, women feel more confident and sexually attractive. That pleasure and satisfaction that delivers to patients the result of breast lift or breast reduction is often completely disproportionate to the objective changes observed by the surgeon or other people!</p><h3>Anatomy</h3><p></p>

</div>The appearance of the female bust is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are probably genetic. 
<p>The breast consists of skin and glandular tissue attached to the underlying muscular membrane by strands of connective tissue.</p><p>Around the breast and between its lobes is fat. The amount of fat in the female breast varies in very large ranges; In some elderly women, the breast consists almost entirely of fat. One consequence is that the size of the breast can be highly dependent on the diet. In some women, however, the glandular tissue is much larger than the fat, and the size of their breasts is less dependent on the body weight.</p><p>The growth of the mammary glands is partially controlled by hormones, which explains why the size of the breast can change during the menstrual cycle or after menopause. Breast size can also be affected by birth control pills.</p><p>Under the mammary gland is a large pectoral muscle. At its lower end, it merges with the transverse muscles of the torso. Under it are ribs, and then the lungs. Contrary to popular belief, there is no muscle in the female breast.</p><p>Therefore, it is impossible to increase it by physical exercises. You can, of course, develop the underlying muscles, but this will only increase the volume of the outer and upper parts of the torso and will have very little effect on the size of the breast. You can not also tighten your sagging breasts with exercises.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6935" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The upper border of the breast is usually at the second or third rib, counting from the collarbone. Across the chest, it extends from the armpit to the sternum, and the lower border – the crease under the breast – is normally located in the region of the seventh or eighth rib.</p><p>The nipple is connected with the mammary gland from fifteen to twenty-five small milk ducts. In the size and color of the nipple and areola, there is a great individual difference.</p><h3>Indications for operation</h3><ul>
<li>For breast lift, the indication is a sagging, normal breast size.</li>
<li>For breast reduction this is an excessively large, often saggy and unattractive breast; breast, causing discomfort, painful conditions and interfering with certain activities.</li>

</div><p>Specific procedures in preparing for breast surgery include mammography (a breast photograph to exclude the tumor process), although it is not always necessary, especially for young women who did not have breast cancer in the family. It is very important, if you planned to reduce the total weight, lose weight before the operation. Weight loss after surgery can adversely affect the aesthetic appearance of the bust.</p><p>The sagging of the mammary glands is measured by consultation: this is done either by measuring the distance from the clavicle to the nipple, or by measuring how much the breast hangs below the fold underneath. It is also possible to determine in one way or another the volume of mammary glands.<br>
Breasts are also examined for lack of hardening. The patient is recommended to purchase a surgical or sports bra that provides reliable support and a uniform tight fit after the operation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6937" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a67005cac22d88860b8bc554cc6dd331">

</div><p>If you smoke, it is very important to stop at least 1-2 weeks before and after the operation. Smoking reduces the flow of blood to the skin and can interfere with the healing of wounds (the risk of complications for smokers is at least 10 times higher). Do not drink alcohol. Its excess contributes to bleeding. Be sure to tell if you are taking any medications, especially aspirin and others that affect blood clotting.</p><p>Do not forget to mention the concomitant diseases that can lead to complications after the operation: uncontrolled arterial pressure, problems with blood coagulability, the tendency to form coarse excess scars.</p><p>The surgeon should explain the operation technique, the type of anesthesia, describe the hospital where you will be staying, the complications, risk and cost of the operation. Do not hold back, ask any questions, especially concerning the expected results. Immediately before the operation, photographs are taken and preoperative markings are applied.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6938" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Anesthesia</h3><p>If the operation is a small breast lift or reduction, then it can be performed under mild anesthesia in combination with local anesthesia and tranquilization. In more extensive breast reduction surgery, general anesthesia (intravenous or intubation anesthesia) is usually used.</p><h3>Incisions</h3><p>As already mentioned, there are numerous methods breast lift and breast reduction. Most of them need to move the nipple upward, which means that there is a scar around the nipple. Most of the more popular methods also leave a scar in the form of an inverted T extending from the nipple to the crease under the breast and to the sides along this fold.</p><p>Most surgeons plan operations and pre-mark the planned incisions in advance. This occurs in the ward immediately before surgery. During this procedure, the patient sits, freely dangling his hands, and the doctor marks the new position of the nipple. The most important indicator is determined by the touch: the surgeon places the finger in the crease under the breast, the nipple should be exactly in front of or slightly above this fold. If a woman does not have a fold under the breast or a nipple is above this level, then she does not have a “surgical sagging of the bust”. It is also important, of course, that the nipples are located symmetrically both vertically and horizontally. To determine the correct position, the doctor often uses a centimeter and special patterns.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6939" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0257bebf9f9e93a9a65d7fe2f152cd81">

</div><p>In the most common method, around the nipple (often in the areola, if it is excessively large diameter), they draw a cut line in the form of a “keyhole”: the round part of the “keyhole” will be the new position of the nipple. Then draw a line along the crease under the breast and connect it to the vertical sides of the “keyhole”.</p><p>During surgery, the tissue of the breast part is removed, and the nipple is moved to a new position at the top of the well. Two vertical incision sutured together and sew up the incision in the crease. During the operation, usually with a large bust, an intravenous intravenously for the prevention of infection injected an antibiotic.</p><p>Sometimes a drainage tube is installed to remove blood, which can flow from the incisions. Then apply intradermal (cosmetic) seams. As a precaution, the removed glandular tissue is usually sent for microscopic analysis to make sure that there are no changes in the cells.</p><p>After the incisions are closed, a bandage is applied on them. Usually this is a gauze, pasted over a special plaster. Pre-prepared bra is put on top directly in the operating room.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6940" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><h3>Side effects and complications</h3><p>Bleeding from the wound: occurs rarely, usually does not require additional interventions. Leaking blood from the drainage tube in the early days is normal and should not cause concern.</p><p><strong>Inflammation, abscess</strong>: It is also rare. The risk of complications with the correct technique of surgery is very small.</p><p><strong>Hematomas</strong> (blood clots) occur in 2-6% of cases, rarely are large, usually treated conservatively, do not affect the final result.</p><p>Specific complications for this type of surgery are related to the amount of tissue removed. If there is only a breast lift, then only the skin is removed, and in this case the risk of complications during the healing period is negligible.</p><p>The risk of complications during the healing period is greater when a large bust is reduced, especially in elderly and fat women, and especially if they smoke.</p><p>The worst of these complications is a lack of blood supply with possible necrosis of the nipple or skin flaps. Fortunately, with proper marking and observance of all stages of the operation, this in the vast majority of cases does not occur. The risk of this complication is greater in smokers (including in the postoperative period), as well as in patients with concomitant diseases. When removing a large amount of glandular tissue, the sensitivity of the nipple and surrounding skin may decrease. Many patients note this, but they are rarely bothered.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6941" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When removing a large amount of glandular tissue, there is also the risk of losing the ability to breastfeed. However, with modern methods of surgery, the milk ducts remain intact and are still attached to the remaining glandular tissues, so that the ability to breastfeed can be preserved. If the breast was only tightened, but did not reduced, then this does not affect the ability to breastfeeding.</p><p>The divergence of the edges of the wounds is predominantly in the zone of small tension and is rarely found and treated with the use of ointment dressings. The scar turns out to be somewhat coarser, correction if necessary is simple and consists in excision of the scar.</p><p>After surgery in Virginia Beach, the breasts can be somewhat asymmetric. Small deviations in size and shape should be considered as normal, but there should not be large deviations. Most of the women had slightly asymmetrical breasts before the operation. Sometimes the areolas are deformed somewhat, which is primarily due to the wrong planning of the operation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6942" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f6666612bdcd33b20bb30a1589b33f5c">

The appearance of the scars varies from patient to patient, but if the incisions are properly sewn, the patient follows the recommendations in the postoperative period, the scars sooner or later turn pale and merge with the surrounding skin.</p><p>City of Virginia Beach, VA ZIP Codes: 23450, 23451, 23452, 23453, 23454, 23455, 23456, 23457, 23458, 23459, 23460, 23461, 23462, 23463, 23464, 23465, 23466, 23467, 23471, 23479.</p><h5>Doctor prices of cosmetic breast reduction in 2013:</h5><ul>
