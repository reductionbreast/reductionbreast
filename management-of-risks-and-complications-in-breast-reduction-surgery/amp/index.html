<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>With all plastic surgical procedures you will be able to find a few disasters. No plastic surgeon wants this to happen. We use our best efforts to select appropriate candidates for the procedure.</p><p>The ability to determine risk and avoid potential complications is what surgery is all about.</p><p>What causes most problems in breast reduction surgery is lack of blood supply. During a typical breast reduction procedure we alter the blood supply. </p><p>Unfortunately there is no road map that tells us where all of the blood vessels are located. There is a very standard pattern of blood supply at the base of the breast but as the breast gets longer and longer the pattern becomes more random and less predictable. </p><p>A smaller breast reduction therefore has less risk for complications than a larger, longer breast.<br>

</div>Add in smoking and wound healing problems increase. Most patients are extremely happy with a breast reduction. Small areas of wound healing problems can occur but usually heal uneventfully. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Complications after breast reduction surgery are rare and mostly relatively minor. On the other hand, complications can occur in the best of surgeons’ hands. Membership in specific societies does not necessarily guarantee complication free surgery.</p><p>The best that you can to is to do your due diligence in surgeon selection. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, no surgery can be performed without any risk. However, risks can be minimized with proper preparation and good surgical technique. Smoking is probably the biggest risk factor for scarring and nipple or skin loss.<br>

</div>Therefore, don’t smoke! Other health concerns like diabetes or high blood pressure should be controlled and your surgeon should have a good understanding of your health history. 
<p>Overall, complication related to healing should be very low and if they do occur, should be limited and not significantly impact the final result. (James Wire, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Complications of breast reduction </strong></p><p>The leading factor leading to tissue necrosis is the effect of nicotine. Smokers are much more liable to have issues in wound healing and poor scarring.</p><p>Diabetics also have an increased risk of complications. Failure to comply with postop instructions including care for the drains placed during operation or to return scheduled followup may also negatively affect the outcome. Breast reduction has an extremely high satisfaction rate in my practice.</p><p>My breast reduction patients have returned time and again for other cosmetic surgery and I have operated on multiple members of family who have suffered from macromastia. It is important to seek a surgeon who performs the procedure with regularity and whose staff are proficient in addressing patient concerns. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Breast Reduction Results and Recovery</h4><p>Breast reduction is a significant operation. When patients choose well trained surgeons and surgeons choose to operate on healthy patients the results are usually quite pleasing and the risk of major complications low.</p><p>Nevertheless, even the best surgeons can have complications on occasion. (Leo Keegan, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Breast Reduction Normally Surprisingly Easy</i></p><p>The occurrence of complications is fortunately small. There are factors that can increase risk, like smoking, obesity, and diabetes. During consultation, discuss your concerns directly and openly with your surgeon to determine whether your surgery carries more than average risk.</p><p>No surgeon can guarantee surgery without complications or a specific result. Even the best experts experience complications. It does help to choose an experienced and well qualified surgeon with a known reputation for excellence in breast reduction. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the vast majority of patients, the breast reduction procedure may creat tremendous satisfaction. However, patient selection is key. During the consultation process, the board certified plastic surgeon must understand your needs, desires, lifestyle, medical condition and medical history before determing if a patient would make a good candidate. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Successful recovery in breast reduction</em><p>Successful recovery in breast reduction should be expected in great majority of patients. Some patients are at a higher risk for healing complications, such as smokers, diabetics, patient with prior breast surgery. Wound healing problems should occur quite rarely.</p><p>Proper selection of surgical technique is paramount, especially selection of how the nipple complex is moved to the new position. </p><p>Some complications, especially if noted within 24-48 hours, can be mitigated by the surgeon with appropriate intervention, like hyperbaric oxygen treatment, judicious removal of some sutures, etc.</p><p>As in all procedures, selecting a knowledgeable, experienced and talented surgeon is paramount. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Key is patient selection and the surgeon skill</h5><p>Breast reduction is a procedure that yields satisfactory results in the majority of our patients. Avoiding complications is the surgeon main concern in addition to achieving a good result. Avoiding complications starts with the first consultation by avoiding certain medications ans stopping smoking etc….once the patient is deemed ready for surgery the remaining part will depend on the surgeon skill and training. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Patients need to avoid certain medications, avoid smoking, and avoid undue stress and acitivity. On the other hand, you have to find a good surgeon with consistentlt good results. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>If you are physically healthy and mentally healthy, don’t smoke, aren’t diabetic and weigh well under 200 pounds, your chances of having complications from a breast reduction by an excellent surgeon are very small. The ISAPS is not the best way to judge the surgeon in my opinion.</p><p>They must be Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, not any “cosmetic surgery” board as these are false boards and are not recognized nationally by the Am. Board of Medical Specialties. The doctor should do breast reduction regularly and have years of experience with this operation. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Smoking is one big problem with healing, otherwise most patients have minimal if any problems. You should be more concerned with membership in ASAPS ans ASPS than ISAPS. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Breast reduction surgery is very common and any major complications are low. The wound problems can be minimized decreasing the amount of breast tissue that is removed, no smoking for three months before and 1 mo after the surgery.</p><p>Even under the most expert hands problems with wound healing can occur in breast reduction surgery as any surgery. If you see a plastic surgeon who says he does not have any of these problems then he is not being truthful with you.</p><p>Ultimately the operation is very safe AND patients are extremely happy with the way they look and feel. (John P. Stratis, MD, Harrisburg Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<i>Breast reduction is safe, but not perfect</i><p>All plastic surgeons can have a very bad result from an operation that is ordinarily safe and effective. It’s part of the uncertainty of life. However, the vast majority of breast reductions patients heal uneventfully and love their results.</p><p>Now, patient selection and choice of procedure is critical. Women with smaller (but still large breasts) have lower risk than women with gigantic breasts. Smoking increases risk. Diabetes and age increase risk. In my practice, where I have done over the years many hundreds of reductions, I can think of only 3 patients who had major wound healing problems (loss of the areola that required reconstruction).</p><p>This does not mean that only three patients had unsatisfactory scars, it means that they had open wounds after surgery that required dressing changes and another operation to fix the problem. The vast majority of women love the outcome. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Breast reduction surgery has been one of the more rewarding aspects of my practice as my patients continually explain that their surgery has been life changing. No surgery is without risks for complications. Technique certainly can play a part in complications, such as nipple necrosis, which is why I would implore you to seek out a Plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.
<p>Sometimes, complications occur outside of the surgeons control or fault can lie with improper patient selection. For instance, patients who have an elevated B. M. I., diabetes mellitus, or are smokers have a higher incidence of wound healing complications, infections, skin and nipple/areolar necrosis.</p><p>If you do not have these risk factors, and your are being treated by a board certified Plastic surgeon, your risk for complications is very low and will in all likelihood have a successful outcome. (Joseph L. Hill Jr., MD, Lexington Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>The vast majority of breast reductions go very well and are uncomplicated, and as you can see from this website it has a very high “worth it” score.
<p>The reasons things may go wrong can be either due to surgeon factors or patient factors. Firstly make sure your surgeon is a fully qualified plastic surgeon. Ask to see a variety of pre and post operative photos of patients with similar body shapes to you. Your surgeon should discuss with you the placement of scars, how he keeps the nipple alive and an approximation of how much tissue he plans to remove.</p><p>Regarding patient factors. These are rarely an issue, and your postoperative period should not influence the result assuming you don’t do anything silly. Patient factors that can influence your risk profile include: smoking, chronic diseases such as diabetes or autoimmune conditions, some medications like steroids or blood thinners, and finally being overweight.<br>

</div>The final one is a bit of a catch 22 situation, as many women seeking breast reduction are overweight as they find it hard to exercise due to their heavy breasts. Fortunately this is the least likely to be associated with problems. (Richard Bloom, MBBS (Hons), FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Complications in breast reductions can occur, even to the most experienced breast surgeons. However, these can be minimized with careful attention to the “nipple’s blood supply” as it is lifted and minimal tension on the closure.</p><p>Remember that breast reductions also have the highest rate of satisfaction in plastic surgery. I recommend that you see 2-3 board certified plastic surgeons about your breast reduction. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There can be no guarantee that a complication will not occur. There is risks with every surgery that is performed. It is great that your seeing a board Certified Plastic Surgeon. Breast reduction surgery are one of the most satisfying surgeries for patients.<br>

</div>See plenty of before and after photos and speak to your surgeon’s patients who underwent a breast reduction to help you feel more at ease. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Sometimes things just happen. However we know when breast tissue dies (or the skin that was left behind) it is due to lack of sufficient blood supply. This can be due to the patient’s particular anatomy.</p><p>It could be that the patient has underlying diseases (such as diabetes). The patient could be a smoker that did not stop smoking as directed. It also could be due to some medications that people take (such as prednisone).</p><p>If you are healthy and follow the post-op instructions carefully you should be just fine but, again, sometimes things just happen. If the surgeon is a member of ISAPS you can be assured that he/she is well educated. (Ellen A. Janetzke, MD, Bloomfield Hills Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>The way to minimize the risk of any complication is to control those factors that we have control over. In other words, this may include preliminary weight loss, adequate selection of the patient, and choosing the appropriate technique.
<p>And the surgery should be performed by a board certified and well-qualified surgeon. All of these things combined help provide a good outcome with minimal complications. There are some complications that are unavoidable under the best of hands.</p><p>We just need to be aware of which fall into each category. Likewise, following postoperative instructions is very important. ISAPS is a good organization. </p><p></p>

</div>But here, locally, we look more towards The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). (Glynn Bolitho, PhD, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Typically breast reductions do very well after surgery. Some of the factors that can contribute to wound healing issues can be pre-screened prior to surgery. A patient’s overall health, if they smoke or use tobacco products, or are significantly overweight, and others are all of concern.<br>
Breast reduction patients are often some of the happiest patients in a surgeon’s practice though. Even if they have minor wound healing issues, the surgeon can often correct them and keep his or her patient happy.</p><p>As far as you seeing an ISAPS surgeon (International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery surgeon) you can still experience unforeseen types of issues. No one surgeon is magic, but some surgeons definitely have more experience in one are than another.  (Joel B. Beck, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
