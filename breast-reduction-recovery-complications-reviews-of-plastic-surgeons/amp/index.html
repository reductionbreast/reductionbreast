<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Breast reduction surgery usually generally has a low complication rate and short recovery. Back to work can be as early as 2 weeks. Swelling should subside within 6 weeks and get better ever week after that. In very large breast reductions, vascularity can become an issue that can cause would complications such as fat or nipple necrosis.</p><p>Diabetes and smoking can also increase complications in such surgery.  (Hani Sinno, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast Reduction surgery is a common procedure and in most cases is very successful and without complication. There are risks associated with any surgical procedure including those you referred to such as wound breakdown and infection however if you are fit and well with no history of smoking then you should absolutely get a good result.<br>

</div>ISAPS as with all professional society’s provide a degree of assurance as you know that the Plastic surgeon is accredited. It is impossible to guarantee results however ask your surgeon to show you pictures of other breast reduction surgery that hes performed. (Amir Nakhdjevani, MBBS, MRCS, FRCS (Plast), London Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Breast reduction complications</strong></p><p>Breast reductions are more advanced level cases in the spectrum of cosmetic cases.  Besides the risk factors of diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, some of the most important determinant of a necrosis complication is the technical aspect.</p><p> Making the nipple base to thin or dissecting underneath the pedicle (bridge) to the nipple can cause significant problems.  Adhering to good techniques and good patient selection gives consistently good results and if there is a complication it is usually small enough that can be handled easily.<br>

</div> Pick a doctor that does a lot of these operations routinely. An in-person exam with a board-certified plastic surgeon is the best way to assess your needs and provide true medical advice. (Michael M. Omidi, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Complications happen to the very best of surgeons in the world. There is no guarantee you will be complication-free. </p><p>However, reduction surgery is generally very safe and it is unlikely that anything bad would happen.</p><p><strong>Necrosis </strong>(dead skin) can occur, but it usually is due to poor circulation to the skin at the bottom of the breast. If it is a large enough area, your surgeon can fix it with a minor procedure in the office under local anesthesia. (Allen M. Doezie, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>IF you are a non-smoker, non-diabetic and close to being at a reasonable weight for your height the risk of bad healing is quite small.<br>

</div>I feel that the risks also increase somewhat when someone is much larger than the average DD cup patient whom I see for the procedure. 
<p>Review your medical history and all other details with your surgeon to be sure that you are comfortable that you’ve had a detailed discussion of realistic risks before you choose to proceed.</p><p>Keep in mind that the benefits of breast reduction can be enormous. Be certain that you surgeon is experienced and willing to take some extra time to discuss these issues with you. (Jon A. Perlman, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Recovery after breast reduction surgery</i></p><p>In general, breast reduction surgery, if the patient is an appropriate candidate, is a safe and very common procedure. Your surgeon should provide you with detailed post-operative instructions to make the healing process go as smoothly as possible.</p><p>There are things that can increase a patient’s risks including smoking and diabetes, therefore it is very important to have an honest discussion with your surgeon about your health and lifestyle during your breast reduction consultation.<br>

</div>I strongly recommend consulting with a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience with breast reduction procedures. Ask to see before and after pictures during your consultation and possibly even speak with a patient who had the procedure done.
<p>Ultimately, you should feel confident with your surgeon and your decision before going in to your breast reduction surgery. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The first thing that breast reduction patients notice is how much lighter their breasts feel as well as the reduction of neck and back pain. Just the same, after breast reduction surgery, there will be some form of discomfort.</p><p>This lessens day by day. A support bra and pain medications will help. Within the first two weeks, there is less of a need for pain medication. The overall recovery of breast reduction depends on the patients’ health.<br>
</p>

</div>One to two weeks off from work fir a recovery is suggested. A support bra is used for 6 weeks. Strenuous activities, exercise and sports are discouraged for the first 6 weeks while the healing tissues have a chance to become stronger.
<p>The swelling will subside over a three month period. The scars will be red to begin and fade over the next year. Just like every other surgery, results will vary with each patient. (Grant A. Fairbanks, MD (account suspended), Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The vast majority of breast reduction operations are able to be performed without significant complications. </p><p>A very important part of your consultation for breast reduction surgery should include your plastic surgeon discussing the risks you take by undergoing such an operation.<br>

</div>You should expect that your medical problems will be discussed, a detailed description of the operation that is recommended and the risks that accompany such an operation. There are many factors that plastic surgeons consider when counselling patients whether they are good candidates or not.
<p>Excellent candidates have fewer postoperative complications, but do not have zero risk. Sometimes patients have complications regardless of being in excellent health, an excellent candidate and taken care of by an excellent and skilled surgeon. (Rachel Streu, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have valid concerns since no surgery is without risks no matter how minor. However, in addition to having a highly qualified plastic surgeon who does surgery at an accredited facility, you should know that some patients do worse than others because of certain risk factors.<br>
</p>

</div>For example, smokers and diabetics often have wound healing complications. In fact, some surgeons do not operate on those patients unless the benefits of the surgery medically outweigh the risks. Your plastic surgeon will weigh your risks and decides whether or not you are a candidate for the operation.
<p>It is the expectation that a board-certified plastic surgeon has the highest regard for your safety and for minimizing your risks for complications. There are always some unknowns in any surgery, but breast reductions are one of the most commonly performed surgeries that we do and most of the time have minimal or no issues. (Orna Fisher, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery from breast reduction surgery has definitely gotten better in the last 20 years. </p><p>Most of our patients will have a reduction as an outpatient (unless they choose to spend the night or have a medical condition that makes it safer to spend the night).<br>

</div>Most patients can drive in a 3-5 days and will return to work in about a week, depending on their job. Every week they are doing more ( and more comfortably after a reduction) until they are back full time in the gym around a month. (G. Wesley Price, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)
<p>No one can assure you nothing will go wrong, but this is an elective surgery and PSs would not perform this procedure if things went wrong all the time. Choose a surgeon that has been in practice and has photos and patients to refer you to allow you to be come more familiar with their work and satisfied patients.</p><p>Wound healing problems along incision do occur in breast reductions that require local would care. Large tissue loss and loss of Nipple areolar complex is rare. No smoking is a great rule to adhere to in this procedure.</p><p></p>

</div>I will say my patients that are with anxiety are usually very very happy they went thru the procedure with their new smaller lifted breast with reduction of their pain. (David Liland, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<p>One of the most common causes for a prolonged recovery and complications are when patients do not follow their post-op indications. It tends to happen that patients feel very good after surgery and that can be very deceiving, even if you are feeling like have had nothing done you did and need to very cautious and still follow the instructions your plastic surgeon gives you, a bad movement can put your surgery at risk and ultimately cause a bad outcome.</p><p>Also what does contribute is your genes patients you tend to not scar well is not the Doctor’s fault it is just how their body heals. Just follow your indications and go to your follow-ups do what your Plastic Surgeon recommends and you should be good. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
