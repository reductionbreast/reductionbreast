</div>There are several components to Breast Reduction Surgery beyond simply reducing the contents of the breast which is all that liposuction by itself would allow. If just the inner breast tissue was removed then there would be an issue with the remaining excess of breast skin.
<p>In addition, the nipple complex is oftentimes disproportionally large and inappropriately low for the reduced breast size. These factors have to be accounted for in planning for Breast Reduction Surgery. Therefore breast reduction procedures are carried out with designs that remove the excess skin and reduce and reposition the nipple.</p><p>Once the skin excess and nipple position are addressed the inner breast tissue is excised usually with a surgical scalpel. Liposuction could be employed at this point in the surgery to further sculpt the breast shape.</p><p>Because Breast Reduction Surgery most often requires removal of Breast Skin there is always a pattern of permanent scarring left on the reduced breast. Occasionally a patient desiring breast reduction fortuitously has a breast shape that dose not require skin excision or nipple reposition.<br>

</div>Then the breast could be reduced by liposuction alone. This amounts to essentially vacuuming the fat from within the breast. The major plus with liposuction breast reduction is that the scarring is virtually nil. Only an incision of a few millimeters is needed to perform liposuction.
<p>Generally, only relatively small reductions lend themselves to liposuction. (David A. Ross, MD (retired), Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Few doctors use Liposucton for breast reduction</h4><p>Typically, breast reduction is accomplished by removing the excess tissue by either cutting it out. A few doctors use liposuction to remove the excess tissue. Because liposuction does not remove the excess skin, I find the aesthetic result is not acceptable.</p><p>The breast skin needs to be tailored to fit the new, smaller breast volume. I often use liposuction to remove fat from the “bra strap” area at the time of surgery and to contour the lateral part of the breast, to improve the aesthetic result. (Tracy Pfeifer, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Liposuction only breast reduction</h5><p>Most breast reductions are done to treat a combination of excess skin and glandular tissues. </p><p>This requires removal of breast tissue and skin. </p><p>Liposuction only breast reduction deals with a small subset of patients with good skin tone, minimal skin excess and relatively small reductions. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Breast reduction and liposuction</strong></p><p>Occasionally, liposuction can play a role in breast reduction in certain cases. Rarely can an entire breast reduction be done solely with liposuction – only if a patient has very good skin tone and a favorable nipple position.</p><p>The vast majority of patients with large breasts will require tissue and skin removal which liposuction alone can not achieve. Liposuction can sometimes help improve contour at the sides of the breast near the armpit area in certain cases. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Breast is made of fat and glandular tissue. The relative amounts are different from patient to patient. Liposuction is used to aid in contouring, but it is ineffective in removing glandular tissue. A breast reduction does 4 basic things: resizes the areola, repositions the areola, reduces breast tissue, and removes excess skin after the breast mound reduction. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>For best results – No Liposuction </strong></p><p>For a breast reduction, excess fat and skin are removed during surgery. Because the breasts themselves are not only excess fat, removing fat alone does not create a satisfying result without removing excess skin as well.</p><p>Liposuction alone is not recommended for the breasts due to mamillary glands, breast tissue, and the issue with the excess skin still remaining after fat removal alone. To contour to your desired breast shape, tissue, fat, and skin are all removed and then a contoured breast can be created for wonderful results.<br>

</div>If needed as an adjunct to a breast reduction, liposuction can be implemented around the axillary fold (between the breast and the armpit). (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Breast reduction is a common breast procedure</h5><p>Breast reduction techniques deal with both excess skin and breast tissue. There are a variety of breast reduction techniques, but each aims to reduce the overall weight of the breast, reduce the size of the skin envelope and reposition the nipple/areola in an aesthetically pleasing location.</p><p>Liposuction can be incorporated into the procedure, but has a minor role in the overall shaping and reconstruction of the reduced breast. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast reduction is simply decreasing the size of the breasts via either liposuction or direct surgical removal. Patient who are candidates for liposuction reduction techniques tend to be young with good skin tone, good nipple position on the breasts, and fattier type breasts (as opposed to breasts consisting mostly of gland).<br>

</div>As such, liposuction breast reduction is much less common than traditional surgical excisions. Surgical breast reductions involve removing skin, fat, and breast tissue while relocating the nipple to it’s proper position. In extremely large breasts, it may require removing the nipple and areola and placing them back on the breasts as a graft.
<p>Breast reductions are a very well tolerated surgical procedure and have a very high satisfaction rate for women, particularly when performed for symptoms such as neck pain, back pain, or infections under the breasts. </p><p>To determine what options are right for you, schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction on the breast would only be indicated for the rare patient with good shape, no sag, and minimal tissue removal needed. It is usually not a good procedure for breast reduction unless it’s performed along with a surgical removal of breast tissue and skin.<br>

</div>The patients I’ve seen that have had a liposuction–only breast reduction tend to have droopy, downward pointed breasts with loose skin afterward. They’re usually in the office to get a revision, essentially a completion breast reduction.
<p>Part of almost every breast reduction is a breast lift that is part and parcel of the reduction procedure. This can’t be accomplished with liposuction. Be wary of claims of laser liposuction techniques to contract skin.</p><p>Although there can be some skin tightening effect, this would likely be minimal and temporary on the breast. (Douglas J. Mackenzie, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast reduction and liposuction</h3><p>There are many different ways to perform a breast reduction. If your breasts are moderately large, and you have good skin tone and the breasts do not sag too much, then liposuction may be one way to reduce your breasts, if they are fatty breasts.<br>

</div>Most breast reductions are performed though carefully placed incisions where skin, fat and breast tissue are removed, then the breasts incisions are closed and the breasts are therefore reduced and lifted. (Amy T. Bandy, DO, FACS, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)
<p>A breast reduction is done by physically removing breast tissue and skin. The more traditional surgical approach to breast reduction results in visible scars on the breasts, but creates natural appearing lifted breasts. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Breast reduction patients are some of happiest patients </i></p><p>Our breast reduction patients are some of our happiest patients. After the surgery the patients literally experience a huge weight off your shoulder.</p><p>Patients appreciate the smaller size the lighter weight and the more attractive contour and appearance of the breasts.<br>

</div>In our practice, 95% of our breast reductions are performed through either a periareolar incision or a lollipop incision. This is because these surgeries allow for improved shape of the breast better support of the underlying tissue and for fewer and smaller scars. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)
<p>In the scientific literature, liposuction is an accepted modality for breast reduction surgery. However, skin redundancy postoperatively makes this option less acceptable in the majority of cases. </p><p>I prefer the short scar reduction mammaplasty technique from France that minimizes surgical scarring from breast reduction surgery. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction and Breast Reduction are complimentary to each other</em></p><p>Because breasts are composed of both fatty and fibrous tissue, liposuction alone is rarely very effective. Most women who need their breasts reduced (due to excessively large size) also have excess breast skin. Surgical removal of this excess tissue is almost always required to some extent.<br>

</div>Liposuction works well in concert with breast reduction, to help contour the outer chest wall and areas near the armpits. (Kevin Brenner, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Breast Reduction by Lipoplasty</strong></p><p>Liposuction is usually not a good procedure for obtaining breast reduction. This surgery almost always involves excision of both fat and glandular tissue. </p><p>The only candidates for lipoplasty alone are patients who require minimal reductions who also have good skin tone and minimal nipple ptosis.</p><p>On the other hand, I do often use liposuction as as adjunct for excisional reduction, mainly for fatty deposits laterally and extending into the axilla. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction for Breast Reduction with minimal to mild ptosis (sag)</strong></p><p>The most critical measurement in determining if breast reduction can be accomplished with liposuction is to calculate the degree of ptosis or sagging. Large breasts with minimal to mild ptosis (sagging) can be reduced with liposuction.</p><p>Large breasts with moderate to severe ptosis will more likely require skin reduction to lift and rearrange the position of the nipple once the breast tissue and fat have been reduced. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are doctors who will simply liposuction your breasts, but the excess skin that is recruited in the process may then simply hang there. A Standard Breast Reduction involves lifting the breasts and removing portions of the breast gland to both lighten and lift the breasts. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is one technique that can be used to reduce the overall volume of the breasts for some women. This is best for women with fatty breasts, as opposed to those that are primarily glandualr tissue.</p><p>However, it does not “lift” the breast very much or treat the excess skin or parenchymal tissue. For the majority of patients, that want a reduction and an improvment of the shape and aesthetic result, a reduction using a lollipop type incision, or a inverted-T incision is usually necessary.
