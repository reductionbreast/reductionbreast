<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There is no pill that you can take to significantly and safely reduce the size of your breasts. Surgical breast reduction is a relatively safe procedure but I can completely understand that you are nervous about it.</p><p>If the size of your breasts is bothering you (and I’m pretty sure it is!) then ask your general practitioner to refer you to a plastic surgeon to discuss your options and find out more.</p><p>You’re under no obligation to undergo surgery and you should not proceed unless you feel comfortable with the decision, but you may find it useful and reassuring to learn more about the risks and benefits of breast reduction surgery.</p><p>If you ask around your social circle chances are you’ll find some women who have had the surgery and will be able to tell you about their experiences. </p><p>I’ve found that women who undergo breast reduction surgery are often extremely satisfied with the outcome, and often the only regret for women who begin with extremely large breasts is not having undergone the procedure sooner. (Jill Tomlinson, MBBS, FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>These breast reduction pills do not work. The only pills that work for breast reduction are the pain meds and the antibiotics that you take after your surgical breast reduction. Seriously though, the only way to reduce the size of the breast is to lose weight if you are overweight or have a surgical excision of tissue. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Don’t waste your money on breast reduction pills!</em></p><p>There is not a pill that can reduce your breast size. I would not waste money. A breast reduction is the only real and best way to reduce your breast size. I would do your research on breast reduction surgery, find a board certified plastic surgeon that you feel comfortable with and schedule a consultation.<br>

</div>Your plastic surgeon will be able to explain everything to you, show you before and after pictures, and maybe even provide you with other patient testimonials. This should help alleviate your nervousness and get you on the road to living better life without your breasts weighing you down. (Sam Speron, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Pills that claim to reduce your breast size are very likely a hoax. There is no science behind these treatments. Surgery, although it may seem scary to you, is actually probably safer than taking pills which may have a mixture of untested ingredients in an unregulated mixture. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>No breast reduction pills that work exist (to my knowledge). Nor herbal remedies or potions-lotions work either. Weight loss can help in certain people. (David Liland, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately there are no pills, lotions, potions that will reduce your breast size. Many times weight loss helps, but it sounds like this is not an option for you since you are petite. If you are bothered by the size of your breasts see a plastic surgeon in consultation in order to discuss the risks and benefits.<br>

</div>This discussion may convince you to forgo the surgery for now, or make you comfortable with going forward with a breast reduction surgery. and best of luck. (Luis H. Macias, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)
<p>If there were a way for a pill to reduce fat in a specific area the inventor would be on their way to Stockholm for the Nobel prize.</p><p>Fat reduction takes place throughout the body when your metabolic needs exceed your caloric intake. It is as simple as calories in vs calories burned. (A. Dean Jabs, MD, PhD, FACS, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>No magic pill for breast reduction</h5><p>There is no magic pill, lotion or cream that will reduce the size of breasts. But, there are many different surgical options for breast reduction that are not as bad as you are imagining, please see a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your situation. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>No pill will make you loose breast tissue. Should you loose weight, you might loose some breast tissue. Breast reduction surgery will decrease your breast size, and reshape and lift your breast to a size that will look and feel good on you.
<p>I would suggest finding a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your desires and concerns. Breast reduction surgery is very safe and very rewarding for most women. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Reduction Pills Do Not Work: Breast Reduction Surgery is Your Best Option</h3><p>It’s normal to be nervous about surgery; unfortunately there’s no pill available that will reduce your breast size without it. Breast reduction surgery can be a life-changing experience. Patients who have had breast reduction surgery report improved self-esteem, self-image, and self-confidence.<br>

</div>They note significant improvement in their symptoms and the majority grade their aesthetic result as excellent. It’s obvious that you’re concerned about your breast size. A consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon might be beneficial. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>No Pills for Breast Reduction</h4><p>There are no medications or pills that will cause the breasts to shrink appreciably. In the immediate period after childbirth, some women are prescribed Parlodel to stop milk production. The result is of course a decrease in the size of the milk glands but this is not a breast reduction. (Alexander G. Nein, MD, MS, FACS, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Alexia Breast Reduction Pills </i></p><p>There is no science behind these pills so use them at your own risk and discretion. You are better off consulting with a board certified plastic surgeon to understand your options. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>There is no way to predictably reduce breasts into a cosmetically acceptable shape and form. There are many ways to reduce the size of the breast tissue including diet and exercise, however all of the alternative therapies will give a negligible reduction in size and will most likely worsen the droop and shape of the breasts.
<p>The best and most predictable way is through a reduction mammaplasty or breast reduction surgery. (Payman Danielpour, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no chemical basis for medical reduction of breast tissue. However, a surgical breast reduction will alleviate the size and symptoms of macromastia. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no medications that will reduce the size of your breasts. The only way to reduce breasts at this time is through a surgical breast reduction. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<i>Fat reduction pills should be viewed with skepticism</i><p>All fat reduction pills, creams, etc should be viewed with skepticism. The adage that if something sounds too good to be true it probably is something to consider. Weight loss in general may reduce the amount of fat in your breasts and consequently your breast size.</p><p>Liposuction of the breasts and breast reduction surgery are surgical methods of breast reduction. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am unaware of any pills or other non-surgical methods that produce a breast reduction. And that makes sense – why would anyone go through a surgical breast reduction – and it remains one of the procedures with the highest rate of satisfaction – if there were a way to do it non-surgically?

</div>To my knowledge there is not a pill that will reduce breasts.

(Carlin Vickery, MD (retired), New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Breast Reduction Options</em></p><p>Unfortunately the pills will not work. It is completely normal for someone to be anxious about a possible surgical procedure. </p><p>With an ASPS board certified plastic surgeon and proper pre-operative education some of your fears will be resolved.</p><p>Upon consultation you will be able to weight the benefits and the risks. My breast reduction patients tell me that this is a life changing surgical procedure for them as they are now able to be more active and less self conscience about their breasts.

<i>The Pills are a Hoax!</i><p>Don’t waste your money or time on the pills. They will not be effective and may even be harmful to you. (George Sanders, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Breast reduction pills…don’t waste your money</h4><p>I wish a magic wand or potion would give us all what we most want in life, but no such thing exists. </p><p>Breast reduction pills are a hoax. Don’t waste your money. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Pills and breast reduction</em></p><p>There is no safe way outside of surgery to reduce breast size. In large breasts the skin has stretched and the skin has lost its elasticity. This cannot come back . Surgery with reduction of the skin envelope is your only way of achieving lift and firmness. (Gary H. Manchester, MD (retired), San Diego Plastic Surgeon)<br>

Once you have found a plastic surgeon that you feel comfortable with consider moving forward with a breast reduction.</p><p>The breast reduction patients are some of the happiest patients in our practice! (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Alexia Breast Reduction pills are a medical hoax</b></p><p>Where is the clinical data on this ‘medication’?

<p><i>Buying these pills will only reduce your wallet size</i></p><p>There’s no medical way of reducing breast size through pills. I would caution you to stay away from mesotherapy or lipodissolve to reduce the fat in the breasts. Depending on your age, a young woman has a lot of thick breast tissue and not a lot of fat in her breasts.</p><p>Surgery is the only well established way to reduce your breast size. In my practice I use a short scar breast reduction technique which avoids placing scars under the breasts. These tend to show in the cleavage and lateral chest wall area which can limit you in your choice of clothing and swimwear.<br>

</div>Seek the advise of a board certified plastic surgeon who has a lot of experience in breast surgery. (George Marosan, MD, Bellevue Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Only surgery will make your breasts smaller. Pills don’t work. But don’t be afraid! </p><p>In Manhattan, we do a lot of breast reduction surgery. It is safe, the recovery is easy, and almost all patients are very happy.</p><p>Breast reduction can really improve the quality of your life. There are links on my web site to the plastic surgery societies, where you can find a surgeon near you. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Please don’t waste your money</h3><p>There is no pill or potion available that will reliably reduce your breast tissue or enlarge it for that matter. Make an appointment with a board-certified plastic surgeon to see what all of your options are.</p><p>At that point you can make your best decision about whether to have surgery or not. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is not an effective way of reducing your breasts. Speak to a plastic surgeon — if you only need a small reduction, perhaps liposuction might help. Get some good advice. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wishful thinking that a pill will reduce your breast</h3><p></p>

</div>Our society has become used to taking a pill to go to sleep, a pill to get going in the morning, to treat anxiety, depression, decrease hunger and create an erection. However, I can not imagine that a pill will now, or ever be able to safely reduce the size of your breast.
<p>Breast reduction surgery on the other hand, works. It is a reliable operation with a very high patient satisfaction rate and in someone like you, who is a DD, I would imagine that your lifestyle would be much improved if you had a reduction.</p><p>Discuss your concerns and health history with your surgeon. (Darrick E. Antell, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no safe way to reduce your breasts through the ingestion of a pill. Your best bet is to find a surgeon certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery and review options with them.</p><p>You may find that breast reduction is not worth it for you. Then again, you might agree that breast reduction surgery is well worth it for you, and positively changes your life. It is axiomatic that breast reduction patients are among the very happiest in plastic surgery. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
