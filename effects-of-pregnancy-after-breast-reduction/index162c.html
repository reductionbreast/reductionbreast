<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The effects of pregnancy on breasts in general and breast reduction are unpredictable. </p><p>There are several contributing factors including breast tissue, hormone levels, amount of weight gain.</p><p>Pregnancy, not breast feeding, will have the major effects on your breasts. The hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy affect breast size and shape in every woman differently. </p><p>There will likely be some permanent change in your breasts after pregnancy but it is very difficult to predict how much will change. Your breasts will change throughout your life. Pregnancy is a part of this change. (Naveen Setty, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pregnancy and breast feeding both can affect the results of a breast reduction. Any thing that causes a change in shape and volume of the breast whether it is pregnancy or breast feeding may change th final shape of the breast when the breast settles down. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Breast changes during pregnancy</h5><p>Pregnancy, more than breastfeeding, changes breast size and shape. You should certainly try to breastfeed, if it is something you want to do, and don’t worry about how it will change your breasts – your breasts will already be changed from the pregnancy.</p><p>Your breasts will likely get larger during pregnancy, just as they would with any other weight gain. </p><p>If you get back to your prebaby weight, your breasts will likely shrink in size again. You may find that you are a little droopier than before, though. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Pregnancy might compromise the aesthetic results of a breast reduction.</strong></p><p>Pregnancy very unpredictable can effect the architecture of the breast. This is true in breasts that have undergone previous reduction. The nipple and areola can move down, the skin envelope can stretch out, some breast volume might be lost, and stretch marks may ensue.<br>

</div>A revisional procedure might be desired by some patients after the pregnancies are complete. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p>As women age and have children, there will be unavoidable changes to the breasts – including loss of volume, droopiness, and loss of firmness – whether you breast feed or not.</p><p>Rather than worrying about your breasts, enjoy your children. You can improve your breasts later, if you need to! (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Pregnancy results on reduction</strong></p><p>The thing you would have to worry about is all the excess hormones in your body. There is also the weightgain. There will be some changes. Without seeing you or meeting with you it would be very difficult to predict the exact results.<br>

</div>Even meeting with you it would be quite difficult. Everyone is different and there is no exact science as to say what will happen to you. (Kimberly A. Henry, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>How Does Pregnancy Affect the Results of Breast Reduction Surgery?</strong></p><p>The effects of pregnancy on any woman’s breast size and shape are unpredictable. Similarly, the effects of pregnancy, and its accompanying weight gain, after breast reduction surgery, are unpredictable. </p><p>The amount of existing breast tissue, hormone levels, baseline weight, weight gain, and skin quality, will all play a role in the breast’s changes during childbearing and after.</p><p>Some women can even breastfeed after reduction, but I tell patients to expect not to be able to. If you can, I would recommend postponing breast reduction until after childbearing. If, however, back and shoulder pain, or emotional discomfort are significant, the surgery can be done before pregnancy, with the understanding that a future revision may be required.<br>

</div>This is particularly appropriate in teenagers who are suffering self-esteem issues that are hindering their social development. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The hormonal changes that your body endurs during pregnancy is usually the cause of the majority of breast deformity. The 40 week gestational period not only allows a woman’s body to accommodate a growing baby, but it also prepares it to care for the baby following delivery.</p><p>I believe that the changes that the female breast incur in preparation for breast-feeding (lactation) are what ultimately cause the underlying damage to the breast tissues. (Kevin Brenner, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Changes in your breasts after breast feeding </em></p><p>It is possible that the shape size and contour of your breasts will change after breast feeding. This may also change the results that you had seen after he breast reduction surgery. However, this should not deter you from the importance of breast-feeding your baby.<br>

</div>Keep your baby’s health first and foremost in your mind. If your breast do change significantly a smaller surgery such as a revision breast lift may be necessary to return your breasts to their youthful appearance. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>Pregnancy and breast feeding will not ruin breast reduction</h4><p>Pregnancy with the associated breast engorgement and lactation can contribute to volume loss after lactation, and to the gradual ptosis of the breast, or droop of the nipple relative to the fold under the breast.</p><p>Studies have looked into the contribution of breast feeding alone as a contribution to breast ptosis and findings have shown that breast feeding will not cause the breast to sag or droop. Individuals should not be discouraged from breast feeding as it will not in itself “ruin” the shape of the breast.<br>

</div>One of the greatest benefits of breast reduction is the lift created as the large breast is reduced. The breast lift seen after reduction is permanent, and multiple pregnancy, or breast feeding will not “ruin” the shape.
<p>Lactation will occur in the reduced breast, and unfortunately with substantial reduction lactation may be insufficient and a supplement may be needed. If breast feeding is very important to you, certainly delay reduction until after your family is completed.</p><p>If not, it is safe to proceed. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Your breasts will likely change after pregnancy even if you don’t have a reduction</h5><p>Pregnancy will usually change the appearance of a woman’s breasts, even if you choose to not breast feed. In your case, I think the more important thing to know is that breast reduction surgery can affect you ability to breast feed.<br>

</div>For many women, this is very important and so they do not want to have any procedure that would risk losing this ability. On the other hand, for some women, the back and neck pain that they are experiencing from the size and weight of their breasts is so bad that they need the reduction procedure to improve their quality of life.
<p>In addition, after your pregnancy, whether or not you breast feed and whether or not you have a reduction, your breasts will change, so I don’t think that should be the reason to avoid having surgery now.</p><p>I would consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who can review with you the pros and cons of the breast reduction procedure in detail – this is the best way to find out if is the right choice for you. (Shahram Salemy, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pregnancy will lead to an increase in the body weight. The breast will part of this increase. You could experience increase in breast size and maybe ptosis as well. The return to normal size and shape depends on many factors.</p><p>It is better not to worry about this during pregnancy and wait until after delivery to deal with it. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ruins can be beautiful too</h3><p>How your breasts respond to pregnancy seems to be independent of whether or not you breast feed. It is a function of the hormones that are produced and how your breasts react to them.</p><p>If by “ruined” you mean ptosis, or sagging, or re-enlargement, then the breasts can be “rebuilt” using the same scars that you have from your reduction. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Changes will occur after pregnancy</strong><p>“Ruin” is a pretty harsh term for the changes that occur in the breast after pregnancy. Essentially there are a variety of changes that can occur and they run the gamut from no change to tissue atrophy to drooping and other problems.</p><p>The more the engorgement, usually, the more drastic the changes. Also individual changes can be variable and a lot of it depends on your genetic make-up. Sorry to be so vague, but there are just so many possibilities that it is very hard to say.</p><p>If you do experience changes I would wait till you have finished your family before you embark on any revisional surgery of your breasts.

</div>Your breasts can become bigger or smaller after pregnancy, and they can sag. After pregnancy, many women complain that their breasts have become “empty”.
<p>Or they can not change much. It does not matter whether or not you breastfeed.</p><p>So my best advice is have your baby and don’t worry. The good news is that, if you need a touch up afterwards, it is done through the scars you already have. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It seems that the changes a women experiences to her breast is the result of pregnancy and not a result of nursing. While what changes take place with your breast it is somewhat predetermined by your genetics.</p><p>It can certainly be modified by your weight gain but the changes that you experience will not be because of your reduction and not the result nursing if you so choose to nurse your new born. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Are you choosing to not breast feed? Do yo think that if you are not able to breast feed you will become so large that it will change things? Many women who have breast reductions can breast feed and there is even a website about the subject.</p><p>Even assuming you do not breast feed, I doubt that you r result will be ruined. You had the reduction to be smaller in size and you should return to about the same size. I would say not to worry too much, enjoy the pregnancy and re-evaluate after that. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Things will change</h4><p></p>

</div>Your reduced breast will behave like an unoperated breast as it relates to pregnancy and breast feeding. Although it is inpossible to predict exactly, you should expect some stretching of the skin and support structures, and the breast volume inside the skin envelope may actually shrink to a smaller size than before pregnancy (postpartum involution of the breast).
<p>Breast feeding may exacerbate these effects. Despite this, breast feeding is best for baby, and the breast can be reoperated at a later time. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>It will depend on the weight gain and your genetic</b></p><p>During the pregnancy you will gain weight and that is normal. The amount of the weight gain and it’s distribution may change your breast. Do not worry and enjoy your pregnancy and if touch up needed ask your doctor after pregnancy.
