The two main techniques for this surgery include direct excision in a small incision around the bottom of the areola or ultrasound liposuction.</p><p>At this stage it is best to discuss your concerns with a board-certified plastic surgeon who is very experienced in gynecomastia correction.

</div><p>Many times in our practice, we are able to perform the direct excision in the office setting with local anesthesia.

In Manhattan male breast reduction could cost about $10, 000 all included. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Price has a lot of factors that go into it. Our price quotes include surgeons fee, anesthesia, OR fees, follow up, garment, and procedure insurance. The other major influence on price is the time for surgery.</p><p>The amount of excess skin plays a key role in the length of time for the surgery as does if one or both sides are being corrected. Most gynechomastia patients need both sides revised to keep symmetry.</p><p>Our prices average between $4K and 7K for everthing. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Male breast reduction surgery has a very high satisfaction rate.</h4><p>The glandular resection of tissue can be partially covered by OHIP. The rest of the fee that is not covered is related to the liposuction component. The price of the liposuction ranges from $1200-2500. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Male breast reduction or gynecomastia surgery cost varies throughout southern california, and especially in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Most plastic surgeons in beverly hills charge about $5000 to $7000 for male breast reduction surgery. Of course, this includes anesthesiologist and surgery center fees.

This procedure is covered by the Quebec Health Insurance plan (Medicare) only in certain cases for boys under the age of 18.

</div><p>In my area of the country, I have not found any of the insurance companies will cover gynecomastia reduction surgery. Even for patients who have developed this after use of some medications, it has not been covered.</p><p>This is considered an elective, cosmetic surgery. The cost varies depending on if it is one sided or bilateral and how large the reduction will be because it usually takes longer.</p><p>The cost includes anesthesia, operating room and all of the followup appointments.</p><p>It varies quite a bit across the country, so visit with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who can show you a lot of photos and decide if the cost will be worth it for you. (James A. Hoffman, MD, Saint Paul Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, insurers based in NY stopped paying for gynecomastia surgery several years ago except for documented breast cancer or for patients who can make a strong case that they are BRCA-1 or -2 based on family history of breast cancer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7648" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Pricing depends upon whether an open technique, liposuction or combination of the two will be employed as this impacts the complexity and the length of the procedure. For liposuction only, pricing begins at $4500 and goes up to $6000.</p><p>For resection, pricing starts at $6000 and goes up from there depending on whether liposuction will also be used. It is important to ascertain that your surgeon is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and that the operation he proposes is what is right for you as opposed to the procedure he can perform.</p><p>Also inquire about the number of female breast reductions the surgeon performs as this is a much more commonly requested procedure involving the same skill set and considerations. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Male breast reduction can be done by liposuction or traditional surgery</i></p><p>Men often are embarrassed to see a plastic surgeon for breast reduction.

</div><p>Depending on the size of the male breasts, they can be treated with a combination of liposuction and traditional surgery. It is usually a 1 to 3 hour surgery. So if the operating room is $1000 to $1500 per hour, the procedure would cost anywhere between $3000 to $4500 plus the surgeon fees.</p><p>The surgeon fees are variable depending on the city, but may range between $3000 and $10,000. Additionally, you may want to check with your insurance company. In rare circumstances, your insurance company may pay for the surgery.</p><p>Prior to surgery, it is important to ensure that you are not suffering some hormonal or other illness which may be causing the gynecomastia. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Many techniques for male breast reduction</h3><p>There are so many different techniques based upon what you need. Some patients can improve with liposuction, some need an excision, some need both, some need the nipple areola complex moved. It really depends. Insurance usually does not cover male reductions.</p><p>As for price, it really depends upon your region of the country. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
