		<description><![CDATA[I am 9 days post op and love the shape but have a new bruise every day. I went from a 38ddd to a D cup, at least that&#039;s what my surgeon said. I have internal stitches and external glue which seems to keep a more fine incision line than external stitches. I do have stitches around my nipples. This seems like everyone&#039;s surgeon told them to wear a surgical bras but my surgeon instructed me to wear an ace wrap for four weeks, 20 hours/day and be free for 4 hours/day. I must say it feels great to set them free but I can never get past one hour before I feel the need to secure them in the wrap. The swelling has gone down some but I do still have some drainage so I use rolled gauge and also non-stick pads that still stick to my incision tape/drainage. The worst part was the nausea from fasting before surgery and anesthesia. I ended up dehydrated and in the ER for a horrible headache 2 days post op. I was better after getting fluids and discontinued use of prescription pain pills. Oh! The surgeon also prescribed a muscle relaxer to take at bedtime which gives me a headache so I take Tylenol also but only at bedtime. No pain meds through the day anymore. I&#039;ve finished my antibiotic so hopefully I&#039;m in the clear for infection. It&#039;s more than a notion. the verdict is still out on whether I&#039;d do this knowing the healing process. Hopefully the result will make it all worthwhile in the end. Right now I&#039;m feeling like I could&#039;ve ran daily and went on a strict diet to lose weight all over.]]></description>
