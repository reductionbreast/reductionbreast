<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Teenage Breast Reduction Surgery: If Your Breasts Have Stopped Growing, You May Be a Very Likely Candidate for Surgery</i></p><p>Breast reduction is one of the most rewarding surgical procedures performed by a plastic surgeon. Normally when a woman presents with request for a breast reduction she is suffering from problems with back, neck, and shoulder pain, and often irritation under the fold of the breast.</p><p>Breast reduction is very effective and predictable in alleviating these problems. When a teenager presents with a request for breast reduction, many things have to be taken into consideration. The most important question is “have the breasts quit growing?” It is ideal to know that the breasts have not changed in size for at least the last eight months.<br>
</p>

</div>If this fact is established, then it is unlikely that future growth will occur. Although the procedure of breast reduction is very rewarding for most patients, complications can occur. There will definitely be scarring of the breasts, there could be loss of feeling to the nipple, and it may impair future breastfeeding.
<p>It is important that the teenager be mature enough to fully understand and comprehend these risks. It’s important to emphasize the potential scarring that may occur considering that the teenager still has all of the aspects associated with courtship ahead of her.</p><p>Many times, the teen has never had a breast exam performed. It is best to first tell them exactly what is going to occur during the examination and evaluation to help put them at ease.</p><p>If the teenager has a significant problem with large breasts and demonstrates sufficient maturity, then a breast reduction can be a life changing experience. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Teenage plastic surgery (ages 13-17) comprises only 5% of all plastic surgery procedures. The most common teenage plastic surgery is nose reshaping (rhinoplasty) followed by breast reduction, male and female, and then followed by ear reshaping (otoplasty).
<p>Teenagers differ in their reasons for having surgery when compared to adults, they want to look the same or fit in with their peers. Adults typically want to stand out or look different. Teens also fear their physical defect will persist into adulthood and be ostracized or teased.</p><p>There are 3 criteria that need to be met for teenage plastic surgery: </p><p>The teenager needs to initiate the request<br>
The teenager needs realistic goals<br>
The teenager must be mature enough, not only physically but mentally </p><p>Some of the most dramatic life changing results can be seen in teenagers, literally taking a wall flower and letting her bloom.</p><p>The increase in self esteem and confidence can be phenomenal! You seem to meet these requirements and I would encourage you to pursue the procedure. Meet with a board certified plastic surgeon who specializes in breast procedures. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>For teenagers, I typically wait until age 16 for appropriate candidates. Part of this has to do with the maturity required to handle major surgery and the rest are medical considerations.
<p>Remember that this is elective surgery, which means that it is a choice not an emergency. There is a condition that causes breasts to continue growing even after surgery is done and you need to be properly diagnosed.</p><p>I advise you to see a plastic surgeon to determine if you are a candidate now versus later. (Orna Fisher, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If the breasts are very large and they are causing significant physical or emotional pain, then a reduction is possible, even as a teen. Of course this would require some thoughtful reflection by you, your parents, and board certified plastic surgeon. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Benefits of a breast reduction can include decreased pain and the ability to find clothes that fit better.<br>

</div>The possible downsides to a breast reduction can include scarring, numbness, wound healing problems, inability to breast feed and infection. The most common types of reduction either involve a vertical or upside down T incision.
<p>It is possible that you might require a further reduction in the future. In my opinion a reduction is a great operation for the correct patient. It is important to document non operative treatment prior to surgery. (Jon E. Rast, MD, Kansas City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Breast Reduction in Teenage Women</i></p><p>There are several unique differences to consider when evaluating a young woman for breast reduction surgery. The bottom line is this:</p><p>– you may need another breast reduction or breast lift in the future after pregnancy<br>
– you may have difficulty breastfeeding<br>

</div>The scar patterns are identical regardless of the age of the patient and healing is usually complete in about 4 weeks.
<p>If I am performing a breast reduction under the age of 18, the patients’ primary concerns must be related to discomfort surrounding the size of the breast (rashes, back/neck/shoulder pain) and not to the position of the breast (or breast drooping). (Adam J. Oppenheimer, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Teen Breast Reduction- more popular than ever</i></p><p>Many teens are seeking information about Breast Reduction because they have heard that this operation will reduce the symptoms they have related to the large size of their breasts. And doing the operation sooner rather than later lowers the risk of long term back pain for some.</p><p>This is something that can be done on a break from school so that you do not need to miss any classes.

</div>If a patient is symptomatic with large breasts I would consider operative intervention at a young age. These patients are miserable and after surgery they will be able to partake in sports and other activities without complaints. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>During puberty, the mammary glands in the breasts respond to hormonal changes by enlarging. While breasts may continue to grow into a woman’s early twenties, most women are fully developed by age 16. If a teenager is a DD cup, she’s certainly not going to get any smaller.</p><p>If you are 14 and have very large breasts, breast reduction may be an appropriate procedure. Therefore, if the size of your breasts is debilitating or painful, I would suggest going ahead with a reduction. You may need a second reductive procedure down the line, but why put off something that could make such a positive difference in your life now? It’s important to be sure expectations are realistic and you have an understanding of the commitment needed for the healing process.<br>

</div>Make sure that you understand the nature of the surgery, the recovery process, and that you feel comfortable and emotionally ready to make these changes to your body. (Michelle Copeland, MD, DMD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Surgery is usually deferred until the woman achieves full physical growth, at least 16. however, if the symptoms warrant the procedure i might consider it. scarring, nipple loss, numbness are just some of the potential problems.</p><p>Consider a consultation with your parents consent and participation. (Rafael C. Cabrera, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast reduction surgery is not something to jump into blindly. There will be scars that you will have for the rest of your life. These will definitely fade with time and be less noticeable. You may have issues with breastfeeding.<br>

</div>I would greatly suggest discussing these issues with your mother and really deciding if you are willing to sacrifice scars for the neck and shoulder pain. I usually tell my patients to wait until age 18, when insurance may pay for this procedure, and you will really have had time to think this over.
<p>A visit to a board certified plastic surgeon will be able to give you more details and a timeline that suits you. (Jennifer Buck, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Breast reduction is performed on teenagers but with the advise and consent of parents.</strong></p><p>Younger patients with breast that disrupt their lives seek breast reduction. Breast reduction is a functional operation although everyone wants an excellent aesthetic result as well. In a teenager, the parents will be part of the decision process and indeed will be taking responsiblity for the ultimate decision to proceed. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>You do not need a lot of scars for Breast Reduction</h4><p>Depending on the position of your nipples relative to your breast, and the quality of your skin, scarring can be minimized. You do not need, under any way shape or form the “upside down T” or “anchor scar”, as there are plenty of alternatives available.</p><p>If your breasts hang really low and you have a lot of skin, you could have a “lollipop scar”, if the nipple is not so low, you may get along with a “donut” scar just around the areola.</p><p>Having said all that, just gather information, learn about the procedure, talk to people who have had it, and have a long talk with your parents. My own daughter went through the same process and I can tell you that this is going to take a lot of thought on your part, and a lot of discussion with your parents. (Ricardo L.

In general, i don’t recommend elective breast reduction for girls under 18. But there are exceptions. In Manhattan, we have operated on a few young girls whose breasts had not grown for 2 years, and who had a lot of symptoms. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Having a breast reduction as a teenager is a tough decision. You want to make sure that your breasts are not growing anymore. If they are very large you may be a candidate but I would defer it if you are still growing.</p><p>Remember that a reduction comes with permanent scars on your breasts. The method really depends upon your size, shape, and skin elasticity. Recovery is about 2 weeks. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Teen breast reduction takes careful thought</h3><p></p>

</div>Teen breast reduction is safe and can be very appropriate for some individuals. This question comes up from time to time and you can find an additional response on my profile. There are two issues to consider when considering breast reduction.
<p>The first is physical maturity. The breast will continue to develop into your early twenties, though growth will slow significantly by age 18. It is best of course to complete breast reduction when the size is stable and no longer increasing.</p><p>Unless the breast is so large that it really impacts daily activity and normal participation in physical education and sports, the best result will be had at say age 18 rather than age 14. The second concern is emotional maturity.</p><p>I don’t mean that you are not mature enough to consider reduction, however you will grow significantly in the next four years and come to understand better who you are and what you are comfortable with.<br>

</div>Certain trade offs always occur. The first is that reduction will produce a scar on the front of the breast, usually around the nipple and down in a ‘lollipop’ pattern on the breast. The scar can be acceptable to you, though it may not, and there will be adjustments as to how you view yourself or are perceived by friends.
<p>The reduction will significantly reduce your ability to breastfeed. This is hardly a top of mind thought when you are 14, yet as you approach the time to start a family after reduction the choice has already been made.</p><p>In our office we often will recommend that a younger patient obtain all the information that they need, and then consider the procedure for at least a year if circumstances will permit. </p><p>I find a very good time for reduction is after senior year in high school, just before going to college.</p><p>It is a good time to explore breast reduction now. Take your time and be sure you understand fully what your choice will mean long term.,peterejohnsonmd. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>I have performed about 20 breast reductions over the last 25 years, in girls younger than 19. I go over the procedure in detail with the patient and their parents. It is a trade-off procedure, in that the patient may lose sensation in the breast, there will be noticeable scarring, the patient may not be able to breast-feed in the future, and the breasts may enlarge again.
<p>If the patient is mature enough to understand the risks of the procedure, I still have the patient return in 6-8 weeks, to give them time to think about the procedure. (Joseph M. Perlman, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Wait until it looks like your development has slowed</h4><p>Although we have operated on one 14 year-old, we usually wait until about age 16 when breast development has slowed. That way size and symptoms can be better evaluated. You don’t want to have an operation at 15 and find out you need a repeat reduction at 18!.</p><p>The 14 year-old we operated on had EEE breasts and they were so heavy she would lose her balance and trip. We have done many teenagers, usually between ages 16 and 19. There is a potential for inability to breast feed, but we believe many patients should be able to breast feed.

</div>Your height, weight and breast size should be stable for 3 years. You need to have an evaluation by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon – sagging and breast hypertrophy are different. If your breasts are only saggy, I would wait until you are fully mature and over 18.
<p>For large over D or DD breasts a reduction can help. Se a plastic surgeon in your area. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Age is only a relative issue. Ideally, you should be stable which is not the case as a teenager since you are still growing. However, you have to measure that against the problem and the medical, socio-emotinal impact.</p><p>For example, if your breasts are disproportionately large, sagging, and causing emotional and social issue with embarrassment, harrassment, or loss of self-esteem as well as the medical issues you mentioned, then it might be a good thing to undergo a reduction even if you are going to grow another 10%.</p><p>You must be mature enough to understand the ramifications of the surgery (i.e. scars, recovery, imperfections, complications, etc.). If approached properly, breast reduction in teenagers can change one’s life for the better. Be sure your surgeon is thorough with you and your parents and spends a significant amount of time explaining the options including limitation of scars.<br>

</div>Very few patients require an inverted T or anchor-type scar. In fact, I haven’t needed that amount of scars for over 15 years. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>If your Body Mass Index BMI is normal and your breast are really large, then now is the thime </strong></p><p>While plastic surgeons would prefer to have a the breast of a patient to have reached their complete growth, it would be reasonable to consider breast reduction in your case.</p><p>If you BMI is within normal limits and your breast are causing you so much discomfort and difficulties with your life style, the I would recommend that you see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to consider breast reduction.</p><p>While your breast may continue to grow and you may want a second reduction it is doubtful that that would be necessary. When you are 14 and in school it is difficult to suffer with this problem and I think it would be good to go for help now. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Breats reduction for teens</strong><p>It is sometimes reasonable for a teenager to have a breast reduction but first, they must be done growing. At 14, that may not be the case. </p><p>Secondly, they need to be extremely mature because there are many issues you need to understand to do well from a reduction.</p><p>For example, the scars are a big issue. Many teens believe that the scars are temporary or that there is something we can do later to “remove” them. The scars are permanent and will always be there.</p><p>Some people are not able to breast feed after a reduction and sometimes further surgeries are needed later in life. So the best thing to do is to go to 3 exremely well qualified plastic surgeons and discuss this with them and think very carefully about the pros and cons and try to hold off as long as possible. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Virginal breast hypertrophy</b></p><p>Virginal breast hypertrophy is a clinical condition leading to rapid enlargement of the breast at an early age. When the breast gets to be very large, surgery could be recommended even at a very young age.(Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It sounds that you have symptoms consistent with macromastia (large breasts). Typical symptoms include back pain, neck pain, grooving from bra straps, shoulder pain, bad posture, and skin rashes. I have performed breast reduction in 14 year olds, but it is not common.</p><p></p>

</div>There are two big downsides. One, your breasts are still growing. It is possible that the operation could be performed now, and would need to be repeated in the future for that reason. Two, your ability to breast feed children in the future may be significantly compromised.
<p>The specifics about scarring vary on surgeon preference and the size of your breasts. In general, the 2 most common incisions are either a lollipop incision, with an incision around the areola (the dark, pigmented skin around the nipple) and a vertical incision below, or an anchor incision, with an incision around the areola, a vertical incision, and an incision in the crease below the breast.</p><p>Scars can take several months to two years to fade; they usually look acceptable, but never disappear. Temporary changes in sensation of the breast are common, but in most women, sensation returns. Your surgeon will ask you to refrain from strenous activity for 4-6 weeks, depending on his or her practice. (Sam Jejurikar, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
