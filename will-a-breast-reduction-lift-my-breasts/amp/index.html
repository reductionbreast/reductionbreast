<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>A breast reduction includes lifting the breast. A breast lift does not involve reducing the breast tissue, although the breast may fit a smaller bra better. </p><p>That can be confusing. Breast reduction is designed to reduce the volume of the breast , taking off the weight that contributes to the symptoms of pain associated with large heavy breast.</p><p>It includes removing shin and repositioning the Nipple Areolar Complex up on the chest and usually making the diameter smaller. </p><p>If you like the size of your breast but want them pushed up then a lift alone would be what you would consult with your PS to discuss. (David Liland, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction involves the removal of excess breast tissue and skin which will reduce cup size, reshape and lift the position of the nipple areolar complex. In other words a breast reduction will reduce the size and lift the breast in one procedure.<br>

</div>Generally, the size of the areola is reduced as well. It is important for the patient to discuss what cup size they are looking to achieve. There are also many different techniques for a breast reduction procedure.
<p>It is important to research and understand which technique your surgeon is planning to use and make sure you have seen many before and after photos to make sure your expectations can be met. A breast lift procedure generally removes only the extra skin, producing a firmer and tighter skin envelope and a lifted and more shaply breast of the same cup size.</p><p>The areolar size is alos often reduced. An implant may or may not be used with a breast lift procedure depending on your requests. And again, there are many techniques for a breast lift procedure.</p><p>It is important to research and understand which technique your surgeon is planning to use and make sure you have seen many before and after photos to make sure your expectations can be met.

</div><h3>Breast Reduction Normally Provides Lift</h3><p>If liposuction is performed alone, there will not be a breast lift. Breast Reduction techniques do normally include reshaping and lifting the breast. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Every Breast Reduction Includes a Breast Lift </h3><p>Normally, a breast reduction and a breast lift have the same incision and same ultimate scarring. In a breast lift, only skin is removed. By removing the skin the breast can be pushed upward and compacted.</p><p>By pushing it upward and compacting it, the patient has a higher, “perkier” breast. </p><p>When a breast reduction is performed, it is done so through the same incisions as a breast lift. The difference between the two procedures is that in a breast reduction, actual breast tissue is also removed.</p><p>In this case, the patient has a lifted and “perkier” breast that is also smaller. In summary, every breast reduction includes a breast lift. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<em>You can get both in one operation</em><p>Many women are confused about what a breast reduction will do in terms of lifting the breast. Simply put, a breast reduction will reduce the size of the breast, consolidate and improve the shape of the breast, and lift the breast.</p><p>On the other hand, a breast lift (or mastopexy) will lift the breast, improve the shape of the breast, and not really change the size of the breast. So, if you have more breast tissue than you desire, a reduction is what you need.</p><p>If you are happy with the size of your breasts, but are concerned about the sagging, then a breast lift would be your best bet. If you are not sure, look at yourself when you are wearing a bra.<br>

</div>If you feel you are too big, then go for the reduction. If, on the other hand, you like your size then you may only need a breast lift. The best way to know what you options are for sure, are to have a consultation with a board cerified plastic surgeon who is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. (David B. Reath, MD, Knoxville Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Breast reduction includes a lift</em></p><p>If you have a breast reduction, this should include elevation and reshaping of the nipple-areolar complex. A lift without reduction, in the large breast, will not produce lasting results because gravity will cause the breasts to sag again.</p><p>The goal of the reduction is to alleviate musculoskeletal complaints by making the breasts smaller whereas a lift speaks for itself. The important thing is to have the right procedure for your shape and size. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Best to Lift and Reduce</h3><p>In rare instances we will reduce and not lift but that is when the shape of the breast is excellent and the nipple height correct. This is rarely the case when a woman has large breasts.</p><p>Usually we lift and reduce the breast in one operation in an effort to both reduce the size as well as improve the shape and lift the nipples to an ideal position. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction reduces the size of the breast as well as lifting and reshaping the breast. The stretched nipple can be reduced in size, the nipple position is moved up to a normal location, and the extra skin is removed. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<em>Difference between a breast reduction and lift</em><p>A breast lift is an operation which removes skin and reshapes the underlying breast tissue. What this does is move the nipple into its proper position and cone the breast into a more pleasing shape.</p><p>In some cases, a breast implant may also be used to either lift the breast or fill out the excess skin. A breast reduction is done primarily to decrease the overall size of the breast, and the repositioning of the nipple is performed at the same time to improve the look of the breast.</p><p>Thus, a reduction usually involves a “lift” as a component of the operation. The choice as to which procedure is right for you depends upon your goals combined with the shape and size of your breasts.<br>

</div>The only way to really know is to schedule a consultation with a plastic surgeon. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Breast reductions involve removing tissue and skin. When I remove tissue, I then lift the breast tissue and reshape the internal breast tissue with sutures. This helps “hold” the lift better. I also remove skin.</p><p>There are two basic breast reduction techniques: the inferior pedicle/Wise technique and the vertical breast reduction. </p><p>Skin is poor at doing lifting, as it will stretch out again, so I prefer the vertical breast lift technique.</p><p>If you do liposuction alone, it may NOT lift the breast. There it depends on skin tone and volume. In general, when you remove volume, your breast will droop more. The only exception is in younger women, where the skin tone may be good still, and the breast will lift when you remove the extra weight.<br>

</div>There are many issues with liposuction of the breast for breast reduction — that is a whole other blog. (Lauren Greenberg, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The techniques used to perform a reduction are closely related to those used for a lift. The purpose of the 2 operations are different. The goal of a reduction is to reduce volume and the goal of a lift is to correct sagging.</p><p>That being said, a reduction also provides a breast lift. (Samuel Maurice, MD, Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast lift and breast reduction are similar procedures. A breast lift (or “mastopexy”) is performed for patients who are happy with their breast volume, but unhappy with their breast shape. This is usually because the breast tissue has “sagged” so that the nipple is below the level of the fold underneath the breast.<br>

</div>Patients who are unhappy with their large breasts also tend to have sagging breast tissue (with the nipple being below the level of the fold). In addition to needing the breast volume reduced, breast reduction patients also require the remained breast tissue to be lifted up onto the chest wall to put the nipple back into the correct position.
<p>As the two operations are similar, often the same scars are used. There is always a scar around the nipple and a vertical scar on the front of the breast. There may also be a scar in the fold underneath the breast (this third scar is more likely in patients having a breast reduction but may also be required for some patients requesting a breast lift procedure).

</div>Both a breast reduction and a breast lift will lift your breasts. The difference is that a breast reduction will also resect a greater amount of breast tissue so that your breasts are smaller afterwards in addition to being lifted.
<p>If you want smaller breasts that are lifted, then you want a breast reduction. If you want breasts that are the same size that are lifted, then you want a breast lift. (Constance Chen, MD, MPH, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The breast reduction procedure will make the breasts smaller and also reshape the breasts to a more normal shape while lifting the nipple and breast mound to a higher position on the chest. (Francis X. Fleming, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In order to understand and appreciate the difference between a breast reduction and a breast lift procedure, it’s critically important to communicate your goals of surgery with your surgeon at the consultation. In short, a breast reduction always entails a breast lift component but a breast lift procedure may not involve a reduction in breast volume.<br>

</div>I always explain to my patients that breast reduction is all about “down size” and “upgrade”. Downsizing of the excessive weight that is causing functional issues such as back & shoulder pain, and Upgrading of the breast shape to a more lifted position with more perky consistency in order to achieve the ideal aesthetic and proportional surgical outcome.
<p>Therefore in my hands for my breast reduction patients, I always perform a breast reduction lift procedure for optimising both functional and aesthetic consequence. While breast lift can be performed with the reduction approach as explained above, it can also be achieved with either implant insertion as well as various breast tissue redistribution or “auto-augmentation” technique.</p><p>Breast lift is a procedure where both the breast & nipple is lifted to a higher position as well as the associated tightening of the breast skin envelope in creating a nice youthful perky result.

</div><h5>Does a breast reduction lift the breast?</h5><p>Both of these procedures will lift the breast. A mastopexy, breast lift, will perform a lift without removing much, if any, breast tissue.  On the contrary, a reduction mammoplasty (breast reduction) not only performs a lift but also removes breast tissue to make the breast smaller.</p><p>So rest assured, you get a lift either way.  (Joel B. Beck, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast reduction always incorporates a lift, although a lift does not necessarily include a reduction. (Steve Merten, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Breast Reduction and Breast Lift will give you a lift</h4><p>A breast reduction and breast lift while having different primary goals, will both help to lift the breasts.</p><p>Both procedures afford your operating surgeon the ability to lift the nipples and reduce the size of the aerolae and to remove any excess skin and reposition the breast tissue. With that said, I think it is important to review the primary goals of a breast reduction and a breast lift.</p><p>The goal of a breast reduction is to remove excess fat, skin and glandular tissue, and to relieve a patient’s body of the discomfort that comes along with very large breasts. The goal of a breast lift is to lift the breasts by removing extra skin and reshaping the breast tissue.</p><p>A consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon would be advised to determine what the right procedure is for you!
