<li>
<strong>Liposuction Alone</strong>: 2 weeks of no straining or heavy lifting in order to minimize the chance for blood collections; 4 weeks of a “compression vest” is usually adequate to treat post-op swelling.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gland Excision Alone</strong>: a bulky dressing with some compression for 7 to 10 days; no strenuous activity or extreme motion of the chest muscles for 3 weeks to allow for proper healing of the tissues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Liposuction and Gland Excision</strong>: a bulky gauze dressing for 7 days along with a compression vest for 4 weeks. 2 weeks of no straining or heavy lifting and no strenuous activity or extreme motion of the chest muscles for 3 weeks to allow for proper healing of the tissues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Breast Reduction</strong>: Mild compression with ace wraps and a bulky gauze dressing is worn one week. If a free nipple graft is done, a compressive “tie-over” dressing is applied over the graft and is left for 7-10 days until the graft “takes”. No strenuous activity or extreme motion of the chest muscles for 3 weeks to allow for proper healing of the tissues.(David F. Pratt, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p>Male breast reduction surgery can be in the form of liposuction alone, a combination of direct excision and liposuction, or just direct excision. I usually have patients wait about 3 weeks to get back to the gym for light workouts and then about 6 weeks for more intense workouts. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Start working out between 3 to 6 weeks after male breast reduction</h4><p>Most doctors recommend between 3 to 6 weeks to start exercising after male reduction of the breasts. As the other expert posters have stated just be careful. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Working out after gynecomastia surgery</h5><p>A large number of patients in my practice engage in bodybuilding or other vigorous exercise programs, and the majority of those individuals might be considered exercise “junkies,” a trait I share with them. As a result, I work closely with my patients to get them back into their exercise program quickly following surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7899" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-776df262a4772db4178d1ca60b035920">

</div><p>They are advised to take the first week off completely, but I allow them to resume cardio after a week. I suggest low impact exercise, and I recommend that they start slowly and work up to a more normal level by the end of the second week.</p><p>Presuming they have no other issues, I allow them to start resistance training after two weeks, minimizing overhead activities and avoiding all direct chest training for a total of four weeks. They can resume chest training after four weeks, and most patients are nearly back to normal after six to eight weeks.</p><p>Following this regimen, I have had no patients with late complications such as wound problems, bleeding, or fluid collection. Although this is my approach, all patients should consult with their own surgeon before engaging in any exercise activity post-operatively.

</div><p><b>Exercise after gynecomastia surgery</b></p><p>The length of time you need to wait before working out would be dependent on the type of procedure performed.</p><p>Generally, I would permit patients to return to the gym to work out their lower bodies about 3 weeks postoperatively but would recommend abstaining from weight lifting or upper body exercises for another few weeks and, then, using the compression garment for support.</p><p>You should follow the recommendation of your operating surgeon and begin with lower impact exercise and then build up to a more strenuous regimen. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Gynecomasia surgery recovery, return to Gym</b></p><p>Most experienced surgeons will have a similar opinion about the length of time one should wait after Gynecomastia surgery. Most surgeons agree that 2-3 weeks is be the minimal waiting period to start aerobic and/or light work out, and in about 1 week later it is possible to start, gradually, chest exercise.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7901" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In my opinion this timing is ideal for patients that heal with no complications. Body builders can usually start a more instense work out 3-4 weeks after surgery.</p><p>But this regiment should be individualized,according to the the extent of the surgical procedure and the healing process. (Mordcai Blau, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I always recommend to my patients that 6 weeks is an appropriate amount of time to wait before working out. One thing to always consider is easing your way back into working out. Take it slow! You don’t want to strain your body. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Exercise after male breast reduction (gynecomastia)</strong></p><p>A male breast reduction usually involves liposuction of the chest and direct removal of breast tissue, and occasionally some skin. Patients must wear a compressive garment or vest after the surgery for about four weeks to help with contour and swelling.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7902" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c1bb3df51dd89060c70aa8397520f521">

</div><p>I advise patients to avoid heavy lifting or strenous upper body exercise for about four to six weeks after surgery. This will help reduce any shearing forces or stress of the chest soft tissue against the pectoral muscle.</p><p>You may resume aerobic exercise (running, cycling, etc.) in about one week. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When you can exercise after gynecomastia correction surgery will depend on what you had done</h3><p>For the average gynecomastia patient that we see in NJ who has a combination of liposuction and breast gland removal, we recommend wearing a compression vest for 6 weeks.</p><p>They should avoid exercise for 2 weeks. They can start moderate lower body exercises after 2 weeks and gradually build up their upper body exercises between the 4th and 6th weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7903" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><p>After 6 weeks, they can workout without limitations. (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>I allow my patients who have had male breast reduction surgery (gynecomastia) to work out in about a week.</h3><p>Understanding that every patient is a bit different, most of the time my gynecomastia patients can begin vigorous workouts in about a week. They can begin even before this provided the chest wall is resting (eg. exercise bike). If there are unexpected issues, then this would be adjusted by they are infrequent and many young men are into weights and can pursue this in about a week. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After liposuction for the correction of gynecomastia, we commonly tell our patients that they should wear a compressive garment in the shape of a vest at all times. They may initiate workouts at approximately 4 weeks.</p><p>However we start all our patients to wear their garments during these exercise sessions. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgery to correct male breast hypertrophy or gynecomastia involves two primary procedures. First the entire chest wall is liposuctioned. This removes fat but also allows for a better contour from the nipple areolar complex to the surrounding breast region.</p><p>The second part involves removing the remaining breast tissue under the areola. Because of the extensive nature of the liposuction and excision it will take at least six weeks of garment wearing to allow the edema to subside and be ready for serious physical activity. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I usually recommend patients wait 6 weeks to start vigorous activity after surgery to reduce enlarged male breasts. Any vigorous excercise prior to 6 weeks can lead to the development of fluid accumulations (seroma) or worse yet a collection of blood (hematoma).</p><p>These collections can compromise the final result. It is best to make sure that you understand your surgeon’s aftercare instructions and follow them closely to maximize your final result! (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_7898" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4dec6272abea3ded4ae883dab720401d">

</div><p>I usually ask my patients to wait 6 weeks following male breast reduction surgery to begin working out. Three to four weeks are required before wounds reach their maximal tensile strength. I feel that another 2-3 weeks are necessary to prevent seroma formation and to obtain to best possible result.</p><p>I do allow leg curls and running and other exercises which do not place direct tension and pull on the chest to be resumed a bit earlier. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Wait full 4 weeks after male breast reduction surgery before work out</strong></p><p>I prefer my patients wait a full 4 weeks. During Male Breast (Gynecomastia) Correction Surgery the fat and breast tissues making up these breasts is removed with liposuction and excision resulting in a pocket of tunnels where the skin is NOT firmly attached to the chest wall.</p><p>The object after surgery is to get the chest/breast skin to attach down as soon as possible without creating little lakes of fluid (seroma). Since exercise moves the skin back and forth, it will disrupt the attachment process and prolong healing.</p><p>By 3-4 weeks the scarring process has progressed to where exercise can start. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This depends on the extent of your surgery and can be prolonged in the event of a seroma. If liposuction alone is used, a more rapid recovery can be expected.</p><p>If excision is required (most cases), the return to activity may be postponed. Typically low impact activites begin at 2 weeks. Higher implact activities can begin at 3 weeks. Gentle resistance exercises of the upper extremities may begin at 3 weeks with progression to increased resistance over the ensuing weeks.</p><p>In any case discuss the particulars with your treating surgeon (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
