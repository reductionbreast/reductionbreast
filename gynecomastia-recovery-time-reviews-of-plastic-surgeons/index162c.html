<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Recovery after gynecomastectomy would usually involve a return to work after 7-10 days, assuming that no heavy lifting or straining is involved.</p><p>I discourage my patients from any working out which involves use of chest muscles for 4-6 weeks.</p><p>I find that most of my patients no longer require narcotic pain medications after a week or so. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Plastic surgeons have different protocols for male breast reduction recovery</h4><p>Every plastic surgeon has their own protocol for the recovery process of male breast reduction.</p><p>I allow my patients to do whatever they feel comfortable doing except stretching the arms and chest out for 3 weeks.</p><p>The discomfort usually the limiting factor. After three weeks they are to gradually get the arms and chest moving again such that by 6 weeks they are allowed to do everything. As the recovery process goes along this protocol can be altered based on how the patient is doing. (John P. Stratis, MD, Harrisburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4070" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is the methodology of performing only liposuction to reduce some of the thickness and fat content, allowing shrinkage and causing the skin to contract. This can result in a good outcome if the patient’s skin is taut and elastic.</p><p>If the patient has a fair amount of loose skin, then sometimes this needs to be cut away and resected. The recovery is essentially the same with either method. It is a procedure that is very well tolerated by men, and usually requires 7-10 days to recover for any discomfort.</p><p>Patients will usually return to the gym and other activities in about two weeks. This procedure can provide long lasting powerful benefits with noticeable results in clothing. Most of the time the treatment of preference is liposuction, however, cases where there is extreme skin redundancy then skin excision can be an option. (Michael D. Cohen, MD – Account Suspended, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4071" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Gynecomastia surgery may include a periareolar incision to remove excess breast tissue and associated liposuction of the breast and chest area. Very large gynecomastia may require mastectomy type of procedures. In general back to desk work within a week, back to excercise in three weeks. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery Time After A Male Breast Reduction – How Long Is It And What Happens?</h3><p>The majority of gynecomastia procedures (male breast reduction), in my practice in Hawaii, are combination of liposuction of the chest and direct excision of male breast tissue. Recovery time for liposuction of the chest is normally 5 days out of the gym, and 3 weeks before one can go swimming again.</p><p>Usually, it is appropriate to stay home for a couple days to get off any pain medication before one returns to driving one’s car. The incision for the liposuction is in the lateral chest area and is sutured below the surface so that there are no stitches to remove.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4072" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If gland tissue is removed, this is done through a small incision just at the edge of the areola. The sutures come out over a 7 day period, and one is normally back in the gym within 7-10 days.</p><p>Liposuction of the chest as well as gland excision both lead to scar tissue which responds well to a combination of DMSO and ultrasound (the kind physical therapists use for sore muscles). A vest or tight rash guard is worn for approximately one month.</p><p>If this is done religiously 24/7, no surgical garments are required after that.</p><p>Normally, at about 6 weeks post operatively, a small bump of scar tissue occurs just under the nipple. This can be eliminated with one or two injections of a corticosteroid.</p><p>All in all, gynecomastia surgery recovery is about a 6-8 week project. As a sidebar issue, I always send the gland from this surgery to pathology since male breast cancer is a reality and should always be checked. (S. Larry Schlesinger, MD, FACS, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4073" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After surgery the patients are asked to take a week off from work. After that, it is best to refrain from exercise for 1 month. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have been using a new technique called Aquashape, a water-assisted liposuction technique. Using this approach, I have many men who have no bruising and minimal swelling and have returned to work the next day.</p><p>They can exercise as soon as the swelling resolves, which usually takes a few days. Everyone is different in their healing. (Jeffrey Ditesheim, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After gynecomastia surgery you may experience mild to moderate discomfort. Swelling and some bruising are normal after surgery and will start to subside in a few weeks. You may return to work with in 7- 10 days after surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4074" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a67005cac22d88860b8bc554cc6dd331">

Cuber, MD, Edison Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery after Gynecomastia Surgery or Male Breast Reduction varies depending on patient’s health conditions, surgery techniques, etc.</p><p>In Los Angeles, and in my experience, most patients take about a week off from work after male breast reduction.</p><p>they can resume exercise and regular activities within a week. They would not feel 100% for many months afterwards. (Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery time from Male Breast Reduction Surgery</h3><p>Pain and recovery following gynecomastia surgery (Liposuction, excision or combination of both) is mild. Full activity is resumed in 1 week and aggressive chest exercise in 4 weeks. A compression vest is worn for 4 weeks.

</div><h5>Recovery from Gynecomastia Surgery</h5><p>Most patients find it an easy recovery from gynecomastia surgery. When the drains are still in place, there can be some discomfort, so pain medication is available to keep the patient comfortable.</p><p>Once the drains are out, usually after 3 or 4 days, most patients find they are pain free and do not need any pain medication and some patients find they do not need to take any at all.</p><p>The compression vest must be worn 24/7 for 6 weeks, taking it off only to shower. This is necessary for the best outcome and to have the skin adhere back to the chest wall.</p><p>The vest can be somewhat uncomfortable but not painful and is practically undetectable under a loose fitting shirt.

</div><p><strong>Patients can return to full activity in about a week after male breast removal (gynecomastia)</strong></p><p>By a week, most patients can resume full activity, even athletic, after gynecomastia excision. There will be a little tenderness in the operative site, but besides that, full activity is allowed. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Gynecomastia recovery time</em></p><p>Gynecomastia recovery time is usually one week. There are two different techniques used in gynecomastia surgery. If the large male breast is mainly fatty in nature, then liposuction works very well. If the enlargement is mostly brest tissue, an excision techniwue is done.</p><p>A tight fitting garment works best. (Ivan Thomas, MD (retired), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Recovery time depends on how much you need to have done.</h5><p>Your recovery time after surgery for gynecomastia depends on how severe your gynecomastia is and what you are having done. We see many patients with gynecomastia in New Jersey. Most of these patients are treated with a combination of liposuction and excision of the excess breast gland tissue.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4077" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For the average patient, we recommend a few days off work, wear the chest garment for 6 weeks and avoid upper body exercise for about 4-6 weeks. Most patients feel comfortable is a couple of days and return to non-strenuous activities very quickly.</p><p>It is a relatively benign and gentle recovery with wonderful results. (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Recovery Period After Male Breast Reduction</h5><p>Male breast reduction can be a very satisfying surgery. The recovery period depends on the extent of surgery and the method used. Each plastic surgeon has their own protocol. We see patients after surgery multiple times and allow increased exercise according to their healing progress.</p><p>Usually arms can be worked out in three weeks or so. Chest will be after that. Again, it all depends on the individual case. (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4078" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><i>Recovery period after male breast reduction</i></p><p>Patients recover quickly after liposuction for gynecomastia. We typically use ultrasound liposuction for this procedure. Patients are informed that immediately after the surgery, it is likely that they will have draining from the access decisions for several days.</p><p>This comes out as a clear pink fluid and should not be confused for blood. Immediately after the surgery, the patient will will be placed in a tight compressive fast. This allows for the faster resolution of swelling and for the skin to smoothly stick onto the underlying muscle. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The recovery time after a gynecomastia procedure could depend on the severity and complexity of the case. Most of the time, patients heal within a week. I recommend that they take it easy and refrain from any heavy-lifting and no strenuous exercise for one month.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4079" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>They may resume physical activities and workouts at about 1 month post op surgery. i ask that patients use a compressive vest for approximately one month after surgery. Massage of the liposuction area (if any) may also be helpful. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Back to work in one week after male breast reduction.</strong></p><ol>
<li>The recovery period after male breast reduction is typically one week.</li>
<li>After three weeks there are no restrictions and you can exercise freely. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>The recovery from a male breast reduction varies depending upon the type of procedure performed. If it is just liposuction it may be just a few days of downtime. If you are having a formal reduction with excision of a lot of skin it may take a week or so to get back to routine activities and three or more weeks for exertional activity.

</div><p><b>Gynecomastia recovery is quick</b></p><p>You will wear a vest for three weeks, but other than that the recovery is fast. All sutures disolve, I use no drains and you are up and about quickly. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Recovery from Man Breast (Gyno, Gynecomastia) Correction Surgery</h5><p>Gynecomastia can present in the shape of the breasts of a 14year old girl, 17 year old girl , 25 year old woman or 80 year old woman. With such different breast shapes, different operations are needed to flatten them.</p><p>With the less mature breast shapes of Gynecomastia, liposuction (preferably VASER Liposelection) works the best and may need to be combined with removal of persistent breast gland tissue. The larger and droopier the breast gets, the more likely the man would need a mastectomy for full correction.</p><p>The recovery is approximately 7 days or so at which time you could return to a desk job. You should be able to return to the gym in 3-4 weeks time. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
